### The Elasticity of Quantitative Investment
量化投资的弹性

What is the demand elasticity of statistical arbitrageurs that invest according to the advice of modern cross-sectional asset pricing models? Thirteen models from the literature exhibit strikingly inelastic demand, in contrast to classical models that rely on statistical arbitrageurs to create elastic market demand for assets. This inelasticity arises from the difficulty of trading against price changes. A quantitative equilibrium model shows that aggregate demand remains inelastic even with these statistical arbitrageurs in the market.

根据现代横截面资产定价模型进行投资的统计套利者的需求弹性是多少？文献中的十三个模型均显示出显著的非弹性需求，这与依赖统计套利者为资产市场创造弹性需求的传统模型形成了鲜明对比。这种非弹性源于与价格变动进行交易的困难。一个量化均衡模型表明，即使有这些统计套利者参与市场，总需求仍然保持非弹性。

### Steering a Ship in Illiquid Waters: Active Management of Passive Funds
在流动性不足的水域中掌舵：被动基金的主动管理

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are typically viewed as passive index trackers. In contrast, we show that corporate bond ETFs actively manage their portfolios, trading off index tracking against liquidity transformation. In our model, ETFs optimally choose creation and redemption baskets that include cash and only a subset of index assets, especially if those assets are illiquid. Our evidence supports the model. We find that ETFs dynamically adjust their baskets to correct portfolio imbalances while facilitating ETF arbitrage. Basket inclusion improves bond liquidity in general, but worsens it in periods of large imbalance between creations and redemptions, such as the COVID-19 crisis.

交易所交易基金（ETF）通常被视为被动指数跟踪工具。然而，我们发现公司债ETF其实会主动管理其投资组合，在跟踪指数与流动性转化之间进行权衡。在我们的模型中，ETF会最优地选择创建与赎回篮子，其中包含现金以及仅涵盖部分指数资产，尤其是那些流动性较差的资产。我们的实证结果支持该模型。我们发现，ETF会动态调整其篮子，以纠正投资组合失衡，同时促进ETF套利。一般而言，纳入篮子会提升债券的流动性，但在创建与赎回之间出现严重失衡的时期（如新冠疫情危机期间），反而会加剧流动性恶化。

### Fast and Slow Arbitrage: The Predictive Power of (Persistent) Capital Flows for Factor Returns
快与慢的套利：（持续性）资本流动对因子收益具有预测能力

We document that persistent aggregate capital flows to hedge and mutual funds predict monthly factor returns with an out-of-sample R2 reaching 6.6%. Transient flows display no such power despite being more predictable. We show—both empirically and theoretically—that persistent flows’ predictive power stems from active fund managers’ capital constraints. As a result, managers invest persistent, but not transient, capital flows into factor trading strategies, leading to factor-return predictability and factor momentum, yet greater price efficiency. Our key insight is that capital-constrained managers account for both current and anticipated future flows in the arbitrage sector, thereby incorporating the dynamics of capital into their strategies.

我们发现，流向对冲基金和共同基金的持续性资本流动，能够在样本外预测月度因子收益，其 R² 高达 6.6%；而尽管短暂性流动本身更容易被预测，却无法预测因子收益。我们在实证与理论上均表明，持续性流动的预测力源于主动型基金经理面临的资本约束。因此，经理们只会把持续性的（而非短暂性的）资本流动投入到因子交易策略中，从而产生因子收益的可预测性和因子动量，同时提升价格效率。我们的核心洞见是：受资本约束的套利者在制定策略时，会同时考虑当前以及预期未来的资金流入，从而将资本的动态变化内生于套利行为。

### The Role of Taxes in the Rise of ETFs
税收在ETF崛起中的作用

This paper argues that a lesser known yet economically significant tax-deferral feature of ETFs’ security design is crucial to their success. By relying on the in-kind redemption exemption, authorized participants help ETFs avoid distributing capital gains and reduce their tax overhang, partly by deploying heartbeat trades. We estimate that the ETF tax efficiency has increased long-term investors’ after-tax returns by 1.05% per year relative to mutual funds in recent years. Exploiting cross-sectional and time-series variations in investors’ tax burden, we show that tax efficiency is a significant driver of capital migration by high-net-worth investors from mutual funds into ETFs.

本文认为，ETF证券设计中一项鲜为人知但在经济上意义重大的递延纳税功能，对其成功至关重要。通过利用实物赎回豁免机制，授权参与券商帮助ETF避免资本利得分配并降低其税负积压，部分通过“心跳式交易”实现。我们估计，近年来ETF的税收效率使长期投资者的税后年化收益比共同基金高出1.05%。利用投资者税负的横截面与时序差异，我们发现税收效率是高净值人群将资金从共同基金迁移至ETF的重要推手。

### Liquidity Provision on Blockchain-Based Decentralized Exchanges
基于区块链的去中心化交易所中的流动性供给

We show that the infrastructure of decentralized exchanges subjects liquidity providers (LPs) to a “tragedy of the commons.” Liquidity providers lack incentives to exit liquidity pools to prevent arbitrage losses, as these are collectively shared, while withdrawal costs are borne individually. Arbitrage rents primarily flow to validators as infrastructure fees, with the median arbitrageur transferring 96% of profits. Proposed solutions—speed technology, alternative sequencing rules, and flexible pricing curves—fail to reduce these rents. Leveraging the Silicon Valley Bank crisis as a natural experiment, we show that LPs defensively adopt more convex pricing curves to mitigate adverse selection risks.

我们发现，去中心化交易所的基础设施使流动性提供者（LP）陷入“公地悲剧”：由于套利损失由全体LP共同承担，而撤池成本却由个人单独承担，LP缺乏退出流动性池以避免套利损失的激励。套利租金主要流向验证者，以基础设施费的形式被抽取——中位套利者需将96%的利润转移给验证者。我们评估了现有解决方案（加速技术、替代排序规则、灵活定价曲线），发现均无法有效削减这些租金。借助硅谷银行危机作为自然实验，我们发现LP会防御性地采用更具凸性的定价曲线，以减轻逆向选择风险。

### How to Dominate the Historical Average
如何“战胜”历史均值

We present a novel methodology for the out-of-sample forecast of the equity premium. Our predictive slope coefficient is a conservative constant that has a lower bias than the zero slope employed by the historical average, but has the same variance. We demonstrate that, theoretically and empirically, our method dominates the historical average in forecast performance. Our methodology establishes a simple yet powerful paradigm for exploiting the real-time equity premium predictability derived from a predictor. Applications of our method reveal that many predictors can forecast the equity premium, and that parameter estimates in previous studies add value to out-of-sample forecasts.

我们提出一种全新的样本外股权溢价预测方法。其预测斜率系数是一个“保守常数”：相比历史均值所隐含的零斜率，该常数偏差更小，却保持相同方差。理论与实证结果均表明，我们的方法在预测表现上严格优于历史均值。该方法论确立了一个简洁而强有力的范式，可实时利用任意预测变量所蕴含的股权溢价可预测性。应用显示，大量预测变量都能对股权溢价产生有效预测，且先前文献中的参数估计确实能提升样本外预测价值。

### Weak Identification of Long Memory with Implications for Volatility Modeling
长记忆模型的弱识别及其对波动率建模的启示

This paper explores implications of weak identification in common ‘long memory’ and recent ‘rough’ approaches to modeling volatility dynamics of financial assets. We unveil an asymptotic near-observational equivalence between a long memory model with weak autoregressive dynamics and a rough model with a near-unit autoregressive root. Standard methods struggle to distinguish them, and conventional asymptotics are invalid. We propose an identification-robust approach to construct confidence sets that reveal the uncertainty and aid inference. Empirical studies based on realized volatility and trading volume often fail to statistically reject either model, thereby providing evidence of their potential coexistence.

本文探讨了“长记忆”与近期“粗糙”两类金融资产波动率动态模型在弱识别情形下的影响。我们发现，当长记忆模型的自回归动力较弱时，与具有近单位根自回归的粗糙模型在渐近意义上几乎观测等价。标准方法难以区分二者，传统渐近理论亦失效。为此，我们提出一种对识别问题稳健的置信集构造方法，以显化不确定性并辅助推断。基于已实现波动率和成交量的实证研究往往无法统计拒绝任一模型，从而为两者的潜在共存提供了证据。
