### Investor learning about monetary-policy transmission and the stock market
投资者学习货币政策传导与股市

We model how investor learning about monetary-policy transmission impacts asset prices. In an asset-pricing model, investors learn from realized inflation surprises how effectively monetary policy steers future inflation. Downward revisions in perceived effectiveness raise expected inflation persistence, increasing return volatility and risk premia. These effects intensify when policy deviates significantly from neutral or monetary-transmission uncertainty is high. We estimate the model using U.S. macro and policy data from 1954 to 2023. The resulting dynamics align with observed patterns in equity returns and volatility. Empirical tests support the model’s core prediction: investor learning turns central-bank credibility into a priced risk factor.


我们建立模型，研究投资者关于货币政策传导的学习如何影响资产价格。在一个资产定价模型中，投资者通过已实现的通胀意外信息，学习货币政策引导未来通胀的有效性。当投资者下调对政策有效性的认知时，会提高他们对通胀持续性的预期，从而增加回报波动率和风险溢价。当政策明显偏离中性立场，或货币政策传导的不确定性较高时，这些效应会加剧。我们利用1954年至2023年的美国宏观经济与政策数据对模型进行估计，得到的动态特征与股票收益和波动率的实际模式一致。实证检验支持模型的核心预测：投资者的学习过程使得央行可信度成为一个被定价的风险因子。

### Resilience in collective bargaining
集体谈判中的韧性

A central finding of the theoretical literature on bargaining is that parties’ attitudes towards delay influence bargaining outcomes. However, the ability to endure delays, resilience, is often private information and hard to measure in most real-world contexts. In the context of collective bargaining, we show firms actively attempt to become financially resilient in anticipation of labor negotiations. Firms adjust their financial resilience to respond to the passage of right-to-work laws (RWLs). Unions’ financial structure also responds to RWLs. Our findings suggest resilience is key to understanding the process through which collective bargaining determines wages.

议价理论文献的一个核心发现是，各方对拖延的态度会影响谈判结果。然而，在现实中，承受拖延的能力——即“韧性”——往往是私有信息，且难以度量。在集体谈判情境下，我们发现企业会为了在劳资谈判前主动提升自身的财务韧性。随着“工作权法案”（RWLs）的通过，企业会相应调整其财务韧性。工会的财务结构也会对RWLs做出反应。研究结果表明，韧性是理解集体谈判如何决定工资水平的关键。

### Financial constraints and the racial housing gap
金融约束与种族住房差距

We show that financial constraints lead to spatial misallocation and contribute to racial disparities in housing and wealth accumulation. Using bunching and difference-in-differences designs, we document that down payment constraints disproportionately limit the ability of Black households to access housing in high-opportunity areas. We build a dynamic life-cycle model to examine the long-term wealth effects of these leverage distortions on group differences in wealth accumulation. Black households are more affected by financial and spatial frictions, limiting wealth building opportunities. Improving mortgage access and housing supply in high-opportunity areas helps reduce racial wealth disparities, emphasizing the need for access to geographic opportunities rather than homeownership alone.

我们发现，金融约束会导致空间错配，并加剧住房与财富积累中的种族差异。借助“聚束”(bunching)与双重差分设计，我们证明：首付约束对黑人家庭在高机遇地区购房能力的限制尤为显著。我们构建了一个动态生命周期模型，考察这些杠杆扭曲对群体财富差异的长期影响。由于面临更严重的金融与空间摩擦，黑人家庭的财富积累机会受限。改善高机遇地区的抵押贷款可得性与住房供给，有助于缩小种族财富差距，凸显“获得地理机遇”而非“单纯拥有住房”的重要性。

### ESG lending
ESG 贷款

Firms increasingly borrow via sustainability-linked loans (SLLs), contractually tying spreads to their ESG performance. SLLs vary widely in transparency of disclosure regarding sustainability-related contract details and tend to be issued to borrowers with superior ESG profiles. While high-transparency SLL borrowers maintain this performance, low-transparency SLL borrowers exhibit significantly deteriorating ESG performance after issuance. Both high- and low-transparency borrowers pay substantial fees to obtain SLLs. The results are consistent with high-transparency borrowers using SLLs to “certify” their preexisting ESG commitments, but low-transparency borrowers “greenwashing” with empty SLL labels. Evidence on drawdowns, renegotiations, and stock market reactions further supports these interpretations.

企业越来越多地通过可持续发展关联贷款（SLL）融资，将利差与自身 ESG 表现合同化挂钩。SLL 在披露可持续条款细节方面的透明度差异极大，且往往贷给那些 ESG 表现本就较好的借款人。高透明度 SLL 借款人能够维持其 ESG 水平，而低透明度 SLL 借款人在贷款发放后 ESG 表现显著恶化。无论透明度高还是低，借款人都为获得 SLL 支付了可观的费用。结果表明：高透明度借款人借助 SLL“认证”其既有的 ESG 承诺；低透明度借款人则打着 SLL 的旗号“漂绿”。有关提款、重新议价以及股票市场反应的证据进一步支持了上述解读。

### Pricing and constructing international government bond portfolios
国际政府债券组合的定价与构建

This paper derives a stochastic discount factor for currency-hedged government bonds of developed markets by projecting returns onto the unconditional mean–variance efficient (UMVE) portfolio. Priced risks of international bonds differ fundamentally from those of currencies. The UMVE portfolio achieves a Sharpe ratio over twice the average of individual markets, with the market price of risk peaking during crises and periods with high inflation dispersion. While bond returns exhibit a strong factor structure, common sources of variation are only weakly connected to priced risks. Hedging unpriced risks in naive or factor-based strategies significantly improves Sharpe ratios, even under portfolio weight constraints.

本文通过将收益投影到无条件均值—方差有效（UMVE）组合，为发达市场的货币对冲政府债券推导出随机贴现因子。国际债券的风险定价与货币的根本不同。UMVE组合的夏普比率超过单个市场平均水平的两倍以上，风险市场价格在危机和高通胀分化时期达到峰值。虽然债券收益呈现强烈的因子结构，但共同变异来源与定价风险仅弱相关。在朴素或基于因子的策略中对冲未被定价的风险，即使在组合权重约束下也能显著提升夏普比率。

### Inflation and Trading
通胀与交易

We study how investors respond to inflation combining a customized survey experiment with trading data at a time of historically high inflation. Investors’ beliefs about the stock return–inflation relation are very heterogeneous in the cross section and on average too optimistic. Moreover, many investors appear unaware of inflation-hedging strategies despite being otherwise well-informed about prevailing inflation rates and asset returns. Consequently, whereas exogenous shifts in inflation expectations do not impact return expectations, information on past returns during periods of high inflation leads to negative updating about the perceived stock-return impact of inflation, which feeds into return expectations and subsequent actual trading behavior.

我们结合定制问卷调查和交易数据，在历史高通胀时期研究投资者如何对通胀做出反应。横截面上，投资者对股票收益—通胀关系的信念高度分化，且平均而言过于乐观。此外，尽管对当期通胀率和各类资产收益了如指掌，许多投资者似乎对通胀对冲策略仍一无所知。因此，当外生地改变通胀预期时，收益预期并未受到影响；而若提供高通胀时期的历史收益信息，投资者会对“通胀对股票收益的负面影响”进行负面修正，这一修正会传导至收益预期，并进一步影响其后的实际交易行为。

### Finance without exotic risk
无需“外来”风险的金融解释

We address the joint hypothesis problem in cross-sectional asset pricing by using measured analyst expectations of earnings growth. We construct a firm-level measure of Expectations Based Returns (EBRs) that uses analyst forecast errors and revisions and shuts down any cross-sectional differences in required returns. We obtain three results. First, variation in EBRs accounts for a large chunk of cross-sectional return spreads in value, investment, size, and momentum factors. Second, time variation in these spreads is predictable from that in EBRs, holding constant scaled price variables (as proxies for time varying required returns). Third, firm characteristics often seen as capturing risk premia predict disappointment of expectations and low EBRs. Overall, return spreads typically attributed to exotic risk factors are explained by predictable movements in non-rational expectations of firms’ earnings growth.

我们借助可测度的分析师盈利增长预期，解决横截面资产定价中的“联合假设”难题。通过利用分析师的预测误差与修正，构建了一个基于预期的收益率（EBR）指标，在横截面上“关闭”了要求回报率的差异，得到三点结论：
EBR 的变动能够解释价值、投资、规模和动量因子中大部分的横截面收益差；
- 在控制代表时变要求回报率的价格比率后，这些收益差随时间的变化可由 EBR 预测；
- 常被视为风险溢价捕捉工具的公司特征，其实预测的是预期落空与低 EBR。
- 总体来看，以往归因于“外来”风险因子的收益差，其实可以被公司盈利增长的非理性预期之可预测波动所解释。

### Entrepreneurship and the gig economy: Evidence from U.S. tax returns
创业与零工经济：来自美国纳税申报表的证据

Platform intermediation of goods and services has considerably transformed the U.S. economy. We use administrative data on U.S. tax returns to study the role of the gig economy on entrepreneurship. We find that gig workers are more likely to become entrepreneurs, particularly those who are lower income, younger, and benefit from flexibility. We track all newly created firms and show that gig workers start firms in similar industries as their gig experience, which are less likely to survive and demonstrate higher performance. Overall, our findings suggest on-the-job learning promotes entrepreneurial entry and shifts the types of firms started by entrepreneurs.

平台对商品和服务的撮合已显著重塑了美国经济。我们利用美国纳税申报表的行政数据，研究零工经济对创业的影响。发现零工从业者更可能转型为创业者，尤其是收入较低、年纪较轻且受益于灵活性的群体。我们追踪所有新创企业，发现零工创业者倾向于在与零工经历相同的行业设厂，这些企业的存活率更低但绩效更高。总体而言，边干边学促进了创业进入，并改变了创业者所创办企业的类型。

### Taking sides on return predictability
在收益可预测性上“选边站”

We assess how nine different categories of market participants trade relative to a comprehensive forecasted-return variable based on 193 predictors. Firms and short sellers tend to be the smart money—both sell stocks with low-forecasted returns, and their trades predict returns in the intended direction. Retail investors trade against forecasted returns. Retail investors’ and institutions’ trades predict returns opposite to the intended direction. This poor trading performance is driven by trades in stocks with either high- or low-forecasted returns. The forecasted-return variable predicts returns more strongly in stocks with more intense retail trading, consistent with retail investors exacerbating mispricing.

我们评估了九类市场参与者相对于一个基于193个预测变量构建的综合预期收益指标的交易行为。企业和做空者属于“聪明钱”——两者都会卖出预期收益低的股票，且其交易方向与后续收益走势一致。散户投资者则逆预期收益而行；机构投资者的交易也与预期收益反向。这一糟糕的交易表现集中在预期收益极高或极低的股票上。预期收益指标在散户交易更活跃的股票中预测力更强，表明散户加剧了错误定价。

### Have CEOs changed?
CEO 变了吗？

Using more than 4900 personality assessments, we study changes in the characteristics of CEOs and top executives since 2001. The same four factors explain roughly half of the variation in executive characteristics in this larger sample of assessments as in Kaplan and Sorensen (2021). In later years, CEO candidates have shown declining general ability, are increasingly execution-oriented, less interpersonal, less charismatic, and less creative-strategic, and many of these differences persist for hired CEOs. We find no evidence of increasing prevalence or importance of interpersonal and softer skills. Executives assessed for the same company have positively correlated abilities, suggesting that high-ability executives complement each other. Finally, we consider corporate objectives and CEO characteristics.

利用超过 4 900 份人格评估，我们研究了自 2001 年以来 CEO 和高管特征的变化。在更大样本中，与 Kaplan 和 Sorensen（2021）相同四个因子仍能解释约一半的特征差异。近年 CEO 候选人总体能力呈下降趋势，更偏重执行，人际技能、魅力及创新战略能力减弱；其中多数差异在正式聘用的 CEO 中依旧存在。我们没有发现人际及“软技能”日益重要或普遍的迹象。同一公司接受评估的高管之间能力正相关，表明高能力高管彼此互补。最后，我们探讨了企业目标与 CEO 特征的匹配。

### Too Levered for Pigou: Carbon pricing, financial constraints, and leverage regulation
庇古理论下杠杆过高的问题：碳定价、财务约束与杠杆监管

We analyze optimal carbon pricing under financial constraints and endogenous climate-related transition and physical costs. The socially optimal emissions tax may be above or below a Pigouvian benchmark, depending on the strength of physical climate impacts on pledgeable resources. We derive necessary conditions for emissions taxes alone to implement a constrained-efficient allocation, and show a cap-and-trade system may dominate emissions taxes because it can be designed to have a less adverse effect on financial constraints. We also assess how capital structure, carbon price hedging markets, and socially responsible investors interact with emissions pricing, and evaluate other commonly used policy tools.

我们分析了在财务约束以及内生性气候相关转型成本与实体成本下的最优碳定价。社会最优排放税可能高于也可能低于庇古基准，具体取决于气候实体影响对可抵押资源的作用强度。我们推导了仅通过排放税实现有约束有效配置的必要条件，并指出总量管制与交易制度（碳交易制度）可能优于排放税 —— 因为该制度可通过设计，降低对财务约束的不利影响。此外，我们还评估了资本结构、碳价对冲市场及社会责任投资者与碳定价的相互作用，并对其他常用政策工具进行了分析。

### Why do portfolio choice models predict inelastic demand?
为何投资组合选择模型会预测需求无弹性？

Classical asset pricing models predict that optimizing investors exhibit extremely high demand elasticities, while empirical estimates are significantly lower—by three orders of magnitude. To reconcile this disparity, we introduce a novel decomposition of investor demand elasticity into two key components: “price pass-through”, which captures how price movements forecast returns, and “unspanned returns”, reflecting a stock’s lack of perfect substitutes. In a factor model framework, we show that unspanned returns become significant when models include “weak factors”. Classical models overestimate demand elasticity by assuming both very low unspanned returns and high price pass-throughs, assumptions that are inconsistent with empirical evidence.

经典资产定价模型预测，最优决策投资者会表现出极高的需求弹性，而实证估计值却显著更低 —— 两者相差三个数量级。为调和这一差异，我们提出将投资者需求弹性创新性地分解为两个关键部分：其一为 “价格传导效应”，用于衡量价格变动对收益的预测作用；其二为 “非跨度收益”，反映股票缺乏完美替代品的特性。在因子模型框架下，我们发现，当模型纳入 “弱因子” 时，非跨度收益的影响会变得显著。经典模型之所以高估需求弹性，是因为其同时假设非跨度收益极低且价格传导效应极强，而这些假设均与实证证据不符。

### Diversification driven demand for large stock
多元化驱动的大盘股需求

I show that as a portfolio’s value concentration increases, actively managed portfolios predictably trim large positions, maintaining a level of practical diversification. This rebalancing channel is concentrated at thresholds implied by regulatory guidelines and by a fund’s own risk management histories. Since larger stocks are typically held widely and in large weights, they experience a coordinated contrarian trading demand that originates from this form of risk management. Diversification driven demand captures a novel return-reversal pattern in the large stock portfolios. Compensating this source of demand accentuates momentum returns during the modern sample period (1990 to 2022).

我发现，随着投资组合的价值集中度上升，主动管理型基金会可预测地减持重仓，以维持实际分散水平。这一再平衡渠道集中在监管指引所暗示的阈值以及基金自身风险管理历史所决定的阈值附近。由于大盘股通常被广泛持有且权重较高，它们会遭遇源自此类风险管理的“协调式”反向交易需求。多元化驱动的需求在大盘股组合中捕捉到了一种新的收益反转模式；在现代样本期（1990—2022 年）内，对这种需求的补偿进一步放大了动量收益。


### Show me the receipts: B2B payment timeliness and expected returns
拿出凭证来：B2B 付款及时性与预期收益

Trade credit is an important source of firm financing, yet its rich informational content pertaining to payment timeliness is under-explored in asset pricing. Using an extensive data set from a leading private information exchange on business payment performance, we study the effects of trade credit payment timeliness on stock returns. We document two distinct channels through which trade credit payment behavior impacts future stock returns — slow diffusion of information and risk stemming from a customer firm’s vertical bargaining power position in the supply chain. Consistent with our first channel, a sudden delay in a firm’s payment to its suppliers predicts significantly lower future returns for its stock. Consistent with our second channel, firms that pay their bills moderately late on a consistent basis relative to terms earn significantly higher stock returns.

商业信用是企业融资的重要来源，但其与付款及时性相关的丰富信息含量在资产定价领域尚未得到充分探索。借助来自某领先企业付款表现私人信息交易所的海量数据集，我们研究了商业信用付款及时性对股票收益的影响。我们发现，商业信用付款行为通过两个不同渠道影响企业未来股票收益：一是信息扩散缓慢，二是源于客户企业在供应链中的纵向议价能力所带来的风险。

### Equity duration and predictability
股权久期与可预测性

After 1945, expected returns have started to dominate the variation in equity price movements, leaving little room for expected dividend growth. An increase in equity duration can help explain this change. Expected returns vary more for payouts further into the future. Furthermore, because expected returns are more persistent than growth rates, they are more important for longer-duration assets. We provide empirical support for this explanation across three datasets: dividend strips, the long time series for the aggregate market, and the cross-section of stocks. A simple present value model with time-varying duration can largely explain the post-1945 dominance of expected returns.

1945 年以后，预期回报开始主导股价波动的变动，为预期股息增长留下的空间很小。股权久期的延长有助于解释这一变化。越远的未来现金流，其预期回报的波动越大；此外，由于预期回报的持续性高于增长率，其对长久期资产的重要性也更大。我们在三类数据中为此提供了实证支持：股息剥离、 aggregate 市场的长期时间序列以及横截面股票样本。一个引入时变久期的简单现值模型，基本能够解释 1945 年后预期回报占据主导的现象。

### Price regulation in two-sided markets: Empirical evidence from debit cards
双边市场中的价格监管：来自借记卡的实证证据

This paper provides empirical evidence of a well-known theoretical concern that market failures in two-sided markets are hard to identify and correct. We study the reactions of banks, merchants, and consumers to Dodd-Frank’s Durbin Amendment that lowered interchange fees on debit card transactions. Banks recouped a significant portion of their losses by charging consumers for products that they previously provided for free on the subsidized side of the two-sided market. The accelerated adoption of credit cards with higher interchange fees likely diminished—if not eliminated—merchants’ savings. These effects impede the regulation’s stated objective of enhancing consumers’ welfare through lower retail prices.

本文为一项著名理论担忧提供了实证支持：双边市场的市场失灵难以识别和纠正。我们研究银行、商户与消费者对《多德-弗兰克法案》杜宾修正案的响应，该修正案下调了借记卡交易的交换费。银行通过对原先在双边市场受补贴一侧免费提供的产品向消费者收费，显著弥补了损失；而交换费更高的信用卡被加速推广，很可能削弱甚至吞噬了商户本应节省的成本。这些效应阻碍了监管宣称的“通过降低零售价格提升消费者福利”之目标。

### The trade imbalance network and currency returns
贸易失衡网络与货币收益

We introduce in the theory of Gabaix and Maggiori (2015) a network structure to capture the complexity of the balance sheets of financial intermediaries, using the Leontief inverse-based centrality. We use this framework in a multi-country world with imperfect financial markets to study how currency risk premia are connected to financiers’ risk bearing capacity. Guided by the theory, we construct a Centrality Based Characteristic (CBC), based on the centrality of the trade imbalance network and variance–covariance matrix of currency returns. Sorting currencies on CBC generates a high Sharpe ratio, and the resulting excess returns reflect a novel source of predictability.

我们在 Gabaix 与 Maggiori（2015）的理论中引入网络结构，用基于 Leontief 逆的“中心度”刻画金融中介资产负债表的复杂性。在该多国家、不完全金融市场的框架下，我们研究货币风险溢价如何与金融中介的风险承载能力相连。受理论指引，我们构建了一个“中心度特征变量”（CBC），它综合了贸易失衡网络的中心度与货币收益的方差–协方差矩阵。按 CBC 对货币排序可产生高夏普比率，其超额收益反映了一种全新的可预测来源。

### The value of financial intermediation: Evidence from online debt crowdfunding
金融中介的价值：来自在线债务众筹的证据

Most online marketplaces are peer-to-peer. Credit ones, however, are not and they have resurrected many features of traditional financial intermediaries. To understand why, we use online credit as a laboratory to investigate the value of financial intermediation. We develop a structural model of online debt crowdfunding and estimate it on a novel database. We find that abandoning the peer-to-peer paradigm raises lender surplus, platform profits, and credit provision, but exposes investors to liquidity risk. A counterfactual where the platform resembles a bank by bearing liquidity risk can generate larger lender surplus and credit provision when liquidity is low and lenders are risk averse.

大多数在线市场都是点对点的，然而信贷市场却并非如此，它们重现了传统金融中介的诸多特征。为探究其缘由，我们以在线信贷为“实验室”，研究金融中介的价值。我们构建了一个在线债务众筹的结构模型，并基于一套全新的数据库进行估计。结果表明，放弃点对点模式能够提升出借人剩余、平台利润和信贷供给，但会让投资者面临流动性风险。当流动性紧张且出借人风险厌恶时，若平台像银行一样承担流动性风险，反事实模拟显示可以带来更大的出借人剩余和信贷供给。

### Defunding controversial industries: Can targeted credit rationing choke firms?
对争议行业的“断供”：定向信贷配给能否掐住企业？

This paper examines the effects of targeted credit rationing by banks on firms likely to generate negative externalities. We exploit an initiative of the U.S. Department of Justice, labeled Operation Choke Point, which compelled banks to limit relationships with firms in controversial industries. Using supervisory loan-level data, we show that, as intended, targeted banks reduced lending and terminated relationships with affected firms. However, most of these firms fully substituted credit through nontargeted banks under similar terms. Overall, we find no significant shifts in the performance and investment of affected firms, suggesting that targeted credit rationing is widely ineffective in promoting change.

本文考察银行对可能产生负外部性的企业实施定向信贷配给的效果。我们利用美国司法部发起的“扼流行动”（Operation Choke Point）——该行动强制银行限制与争议行业企业的业务关系——作为准实验。借助监管层面的贷款级数据，我们发现，被点名的银行确实减少了贷款并终止了与受影响企业的关系。然而，绝大多数企业得以在几乎同等条件下从未被点名的银行获得完全替代的信贷。总体而言，受影响企业的绩效与投资并未出现显著变化，表明定向信贷配给在促成实质改变方面基本无效。

### Mergers and acquisitions, technological change, and inequality
并购、技术变革与不平等

Mergers and acquisitions (M&As) are an important mechanism through which technology is adopted by firms. Firms with greater technological skill acquire less tech-savvy firms and, subsequently, increase technology investment at the target. This has important implications for labor reallocation following M&As. We show that target establishments become less routine intensive post-M&A, especially when a target had greater routine occupational employment, compared to its acquirer, ex-ante. We also provide evidence consistent with targets investing in information technology which tends to displace more office routine occupations. Such labor reallocation impacts wages, resulting in higher pay inequality within target establishments.

并购（M&A）是企业采纳技术的重要机制。技术实力更强的企业会收购技术相对落后的目标公司，并随后加大对其的技术投资，这对并购后的劳动力再配置产生深远影响。我们发现，与收购方相比，目标机构在并购前的常规职业就业比例越高，并购后其常规化程度下降越明显。证据还表明，目标企业会投资于信息技术，从而替代更多办公室常规岗位。此类劳动力再配置影响工资水平，导致目标机构内部的薪酬不平等扩大。

### Macroeconomic drivers and the pricing of uncertainty, inflation, and bonds
宏观经济驱动因素与不确定性、通胀和债券定价

The correlation between uncertainty shocks, as measured by changes in the VIX, and changes in break-even inflation rates declined and turned negative after the Great Recession. This estimated time-varying correlation is shown to be consistent with the predictions of a standard New Keynesian model with a lower bound on interest rates and a trend decline in the natural rate of interest. In one equilibrium of the model, higher uncertainty raises the probability of large shocks that leave the central bank constrained by the lower bound and unable to offset negative shocks. Resulting inflation shortfalls lower average inflation rates.

以 VIX 变化衡量的不确定性冲击与盈亏平衡通胀率变动之间的相关性，在大衰退后下降并转为负值。这一时变相关性的估计结果，与带有利率零下限且自然利率呈趋势性下降的基准新凯恩斯模型预测一致。在模型的一个均衡中，不确定性上升会提高出现大冲击的概率，使央行受零下限约束而无法充分对冲负面冲击，由此导致的通胀缺口拉低了平均通胀水平。

### Machine learning from a “Universe” of signals: The role of feature engineering
基于信号全集的机器学习：特征工程的作用

We construct real-time machine learning strategies based on a “universe” of fundamental signals. The out-of-sample performance of these strategies is economically meaningful and statistically significant, but considerably weaker than those documented by prior studies that use curated sets of signals as predictors. Strategies based on a simple recursive ranking of each signal’s past performance also yield substantially better out-of-sample performance. We find qualitatively similar results when examining past-return-based signals. Our results underscore the key role of feature engineering and, more broadly, inductive biases in enhancing the economic benefits of machine learning investment strategies.

我们基于基本面信号全集构建了实时机器学习策略。这些策略的样本外表现具有经济意义且统计显著，但远弱于此前使用精选信号集作为预测因子的研究中所记录的表现。此外，基于各信号过往表现进行简单递归排序的策略，也能产生显著更优的样本外表现。在考察基于过往收益的信号时，我们同样发现了定性相似的结果。我们的研究结果凸显了特征工程的关键作用；更广泛地说，也凸显了归纳偏差在提升机器学习投资策略经济收益中的关键作用。

### Climbing and falling off the ladder: Asset pricing implications of labor market event risk
攀上与跌落阶梯：劳动力市场“事件风险”的资产定价含义

Administrative earnings data reveal that households are exposed to large, countercyclical idiosyncratic tail risks in labor earnings. I illustrate how these risks affect asset prices within an asset pricing framework with recursive preferences, heterogeneous agents and incomplete markets. Quantitatively, a model in which agents face a time-varying probability of experiencing a rare, idiosyncratic disaster, with parameters disciplined by data, matches the level and dynamics of the equity premium. Stock returns are highly informative about labor market event risk, and, consistent with model predictions, initial claims for unemployment, a proxy for labor market uncertainty, is a highly robust predictor of returns.

行政收入数据显示，家庭面临顺周期且规模巨大的特质性尾部收入风险。我在一个具有递归偏好、异质性主体和不完全市场的资产定价框架中，阐释这类风险如何影响资产价格。定量结果表明，若代理人面临随时间变化的罕见特质性灾难概率，并用数据校准参数，模型可匹配股权溢价的水平与动态。股票收益对劳动力市场事件风险高度敏感；与模型预测一致，首次失业救济申请——劳动力市场不确定性的代理变量——对收益具有极强的预测能力。

### Information-based pricing in specialized lending
基于信息的专业化贷款定价

We study how competition between asymmetrically informed banks, one specialized and one nonspecialized, affects loan prices. Both banks possess “general” signals regarding the borrower’s quality, which they use to screen loans. The specialized bank also has access to a “specialized” signal on which it bases its loan pricing. This private information-based pricing makes the specialized bank bid more aggressively, mitigating the informational rent effect that gives it monopolistic power. Our findings explain why loans from specialized lenders feature lower interest rates and better ex post performance. Supporting empirical evidence emphasizes the role of specialized information in shaping credit market outcomes.

我们研究在信息不对称的两家银行——一家专业化、一家非专业化——之间竞争如何影响贷款价格。两家银行均掌握关于借款人质量的“通用”信号，用于筛选贷款；专业化银行还额外获得一条“专业”信号，并据此定价。这种基于私有信息的定价使专业化银行出价更激进，从而削弱了其因信息租金而拥有的垄断力量。研究发现，专业化银行的贷款利率更低、事后表现更好，实证结果也印证了专业信息在信贷市场结果中的关键作用。

### Loan guarantees, bank lending and credit risk reallocation
贷款担保、银行放贷与信贷风险再分配

Do banks extending government-guaranteed loans simultaneously reduce their risk exposure to firms? Using unique euro-area credit register data and the COVID-19 guarantee programs as a laboratory, we find that 1 euro of guaranteed lending was associated with a reduction of 28 cents in non-guaranteed credit, relative to other banks lending to the same firm. Substitution was highest for riskier and smaller firms in more affected sectors and for stronger banks. Nevertheless, banks offered cheaper credit and longer maturities to guaranteed loan recipients, especially more fragile ones. This improvement in lending terms is the flipside of credit substitution.

银行在发放政府担保贷款的同时，会减少对企业的风险敞口吗？利用欧元区独有的信贷登记数据，并以 COVID-19 担保计划为自然实验，我们发现：相对于同一家企业的其他贷款银行，每发放 1 欧元担保贷款，银行会同步削减 0.28 欧元的非担保信贷。替代效应在风险更高、规模更小、受疫情冲击更严重的行业企业中最为突出，且多由资本实力更强的银行实施。尽管如此，银行仍向获得担保的借款人——尤其是更脆弱的企业——提供更低的利率和更长的期限，这种信贷条件的改善正是风险替代的另一面。

### Stakes and investor behaviors
风险敞口与投资者行为

We examine how stakes affect investor behaviors. In our unique setting, investors trade stocks in real accounts using their own money and simultaneously in a simulated setting. Our real-world within-investor estimation shows that investors exhibit stronger biases and perform worse in higher-stakes real accounts than in lower-stakes simulated accounts. Investors exhibit strong biases in both types of accounts, and the biases in both are strongly positively correlated. Such behavioral consistency suggests that low-stakes experiments are informative about real-world behaviors. Using additional account-level datasets, we demonstrate external validity by documenting a stronger (reverse) disposition effect on stocks (funds) with greater portfolio weights.

本文研究风险敞口如何影响投资者行为。在我们的独特研究场景中，投资者一方面通过使用自有资金的真实账户交易股票，另一方面同时在模拟场景中进行股票交易。基于现实场景的投资者内估计结果显示，相较于低风险敞口的模拟账户，投资者在高风险敞口的真实账户中表现出更显著的行为偏差，且投资业绩更差。
投资者在两类账户中均表现出明显的行为偏差，且两类账户中的偏差呈强正相关。这种行为一致性表明，低风险敞口实验对现实场景中的投资者行为具有参考意义。通过使用额外的账户级数据集，我们证实了在投资组合权重更高的股票（或基金）上，（反向）处置效应更为显著，从而验证了研究结果的外部有效性。

### The retail habitat
散户栖息地

Retail investors trade hard-to-value stocks. We document a large and persistent spread in the stock-level intensity of retail trading, even allowing for known biases in the attribution of retail trades. Stocks with a high share of retail-initiated trades exhibit higher shares of intangible capital, longer duration cash flows, and a higher likelihood of being mispriced. Consistent with retail-favored stocks being harder to value, we document that these stocks are less sensitive to earnings news and more sensitive to retail order imbalances. Such segmentation of trading intensity arises in a model where informed investors face a trade-off between the benefits of hiding their trades within noisy retail investor order flow and the costs of producing information about the fundamentals of hard-to-value stocks.

散户投资者交易的是那些难以估值的股票。我们记录到，即便在已知的散户交易归因偏差下，股票层面的散户交易强度仍存在巨大且持久的差异。那些由散户发起交易占比高的股票，往往拥有更高比例的无形资本、更长期的现金流，且更可能被错误定价。与“散户偏爱的股票更难估值”这一观点一致，我们发现这些股票对盈利新闻的反应较弱，却对散户订单失衡更为敏感。在一个模型中，这种交易强度的分化源于知情投资者面临的权衡：一方面，将交易隐藏在噪音较大的散户订单流中可带来好处；另一方面，他们又必须为那些难以估值的股票付出信息生产成本。

### Overvaluing simple bets: Evidence from the options market
高估简单押注：来自期权市场的证据

We document a new anomaly that we prove standard preference models are unable to capture, regardless of functional form or parametric specification used. Analyzing trading behavior in the binary option market for retail investors, we find that market participants purchase binary options although strictly dominant bull spreads are available at lower prices: 15% of S&P index, 19% of gold, and 25% of silver trades violate no-dominance conditions consistently across three different asset classes. Buyers of dominated binaries lose on average 34% of the contract price by forgoing the dominating product. We prove that neither prospect theory nor ambiguity aversion nor other popular theoretical justifications for retail anomalies such as rational inattention and salience, can capture these results. We also test for, and reject, standard financial explanations including trading costs, liquidity, exchange fixed effects, and noise trading. We show that our results are consistent with retail investors valuing simple, easy-to-understand binary bets. Our work provides a theoretically-grounded empirical impetus for research in behavioral finance which goes beyond historically pervasive utility frameworks.

我们发现了一种新的异象，并证明无论采用何种函数形式或参数设定，标准偏好模型都无法解释。在分析散户投资者的二元期权交易行为时，我们看到：市场上存在严格占优且价格更低的牛市价差合约，投资者却仍旧购买二元期权——标普指数、黄金、白银三个不同资产类别中，分别有 15%、19%、25% 的交易持续违反“无占优”条件。购买被占优二元期权的投资者，因放弃占优产品平均损失合约价格的 34%。我们证明，前景理论、模糊厌恶，以及理性忽视、显著性等主流解释零售异象的理论，均无法涵盖该现象。同时，我们也检验并排除了交易成本、流动性、交易所固定效应、噪声交易等标准金融解释。结果显示，散户投资者只是更青睐简单、易懂的二元押注。本文为超越传统效用框架的行为金融研究提供了具有理论基础的实证推动力。

### The marginal value of public pension wealth: Evidence from border house prices
公共养老金财富的边际价值：来自边界房价的证据

We study how state pension windfalls affect property prices near state borders, where theory suggests real estate reflects the value of additional public resources. Windfalls, representing a source of state revenue about half the size of total taxes, provide economically significant and plausibly exogenous variation in fiscal conditions. We find that each dollar of pension asset returns increases border house prices by approximately two dollars, suggesting that governments allocate additional funds towards high-value projects or tax abatement rather than wasting incremental resources. Evidence of larger effects in financially constrained municipalities highlights how fiscal resources amplify welfare effects of economic shocks.

我们研究州养老金“意外之财”如何影响州边界附近的房价；理论认为，在这些地区，房地产价格会反映额外公共资源的价值。养老金意外收益约为州总税收一半的财政收入来源，为财政状况提供了经济显著且外生的事先变化。我们发现，每1美元的养老金资产收益大约使边界房价上涨2美元，表明政府将额外资金用于高价值项目或减税，而非浪费边际资源。在财政受限的市镇，效应更大，说明财政资源会放大经济冲击的福利影响。

### Household debt overhang and human capital investment
家庭债务积压与人力资本投资

Unlike labor income, human capital is inseparable from individuals and does not completely accrue to creditors. Therefore, human capital investment is more resilient to “debt overhang” than labor supply. We develop a dynamic model displaying this difference. We find that while both labor supply and human capital investment are hump-shaped in household indebtedness, human capital investment declines less aggressively as indebtedness builds up. Importantly, because human capital is only valuable when households expect to supply labor, the greater reduction in labor supply due to debt overhang back-propagates into ex-ante human capital investment. We provide empirical support for the model.

与劳动收入不同，人力资本与个体不可分离，也无法完全用于偿还债权人，因此人力资本投资对“债务积压”的韧性高于劳动供给。我们构建动态模型刻画这一差异：二者均随家庭负债呈倒U形，但人力资本投资在负债上升时下降更缓。关键机制在于，人力资本只有在家庭预期将提供劳动时才具价值，故债务积压导致的劳动供给更大萎缩会反向抑制事前的人力资本投资。我们提供了支持模型的实证证据。

### Firm uncertainty and households: Spending, savings, and risks
企业不确定性与家庭：支出、储蓄与风险

Using daily banking and credit card data for thousands of households linked to U.S. publicly listed employers, we find novel evidence that firm-specific uncertainty persistently reduces future spending and spurs precautionary savings. A one-standard-deviation rise in option-implied firm volatility—akin to the S&P 500 VIX—predicts a $106 monthly spending drop (8 hours of wages) and a $193 increase in bank balances, reflecting notable cutbacks in typical non-durable goods and services. The mechanism operates through heightened household risks: firm uncertainty expands both income and consumption risk over the next year, with the largest effects among lower and top earners (notably the top 1%). Employers only partly shield earnings, while households only partly self-insulate consumption risk via smoothing channels. Detrimental uncertainty effects on households are stronger than firm stock price declines.

利用数千个美国家庭的每日银行及信用卡数据，并将其与上市雇主公司匹配，我们获得新证据：企业特有的不确定性会持续压低未来支出并刺激预防性储蓄。期权隐含公司波动率每上升一个标准差（类似标普500 VIX），家庭月支出减少106美元（约8小时工资），银行余额增加193美元，削减主要集中在日常非耐用品和服务。机制在于家庭风险显著上升：企业不确定性在未来一年内同时扩大收入风险和消费风险，其中最低收入者和最高收入者（尤其前1%）受影响最大。雇主仅能部分缓冲收入冲击，家庭也只能通过有限平滑渠道部分自保险。不确定性对家庭的负面冲击甚至大于企业股价下跌本身。

### When do short sellers trade? Evidence from intraday data and implications for informed trading models
空头何时交易？——基于日内数据与知情交易模型的证据

Using 2015–2019 intraday short sale data from CBOE, we show that shorting flows near the open, middle, and close all negatively predict future returns, but the shorting flows near the open and middle have stronger predictive power than shorting flows near the close. We relate our findings to three informed trading models with different predictions on the timing of the trades. The long term predictive power of shorting flows near the open and midday is consistent with Kyle’s (1985) model of steady trading; the intraday variation in shorting flows’ predictive power is more consistent with Holden and Subrahmanyam’s (1992) aggressive trading model, in the sense that predictive power of shorting flows is stronger when there is greater urgency to trade at open and when the securities lending market is more competitive; and the liquidity timing hypothesis from Collin-Dufresne and Fos (2016) is also supported by the finding that opening shorting flows increase for firms with better liquidity conditions.

利用 CBOE 2015–2019 年日内融券卖空数据，我们发现：开盘、盘中和收盘附近的卖空流量均能负向预测未来收益，但开盘与盘中的预测力明显强于收盘。结合三种知情交易模型解读结果：①开盘及午盘长期预测力符合 Kyle(1985) 的“持续交易”假说；②预测力日内变化更支持 Holden-Subrahmanyam(1992) 的“激进交易”模型——当开盘交易紧迫性高或融券市场竞争激烈时，卖空信号更强；③ Collin-Dufresne & Fos(2016) 的“流动性择时”假说同样得到验证：流动性越好的股票，开盘卖空流量越大。

### Polarization, purpose and profit
极化、使命与利润

We present a model in which firms compete for workers who value nonpecuniary job attributes, such as purpose, sustainability, political stances, or working conditions. Firms adopt production technologies that enable them to offer jobs with varying levels of these desirable attributes. Firms’ profits are higher when they cater to workers with extreme preferences. In a competitive assignment equilibrium, firms become polarized and not only reflect but also amplify the polarized preferences of the general population. More polarized sectors exhibit higher profits, lower average wages, and a reduced labor share of value added. Sustainable investing amplifies firm polarization.

我们构建了一个模型，企业为争夺重视非金钱工作属性的劳动者而竞争，这些属性包括使命意义、可持续性、政治立场或工作条件。企业采用不同的生产技术，从而能够提供具有不同程度这些受欢迎属性的工作岗位。当企业迎合具有极端偏好的劳动者时，其利润更高。在竞争性分配均衡中，企业变得极化，不仅反映而且放大了普通人群的极化偏好。极化程度更高的行业表现出更高的利润、更低的平均工资以及更低的劳动收入占比。可持续投资加剧了企业的极化现象。

### Measurement and effects of bank exit policies
银行退出政策的度量与影响

We study whether exit policies by financial institutions have financial and real consequences on the firms they target, using bank coal exit policies as a laboratory. In contrast to theories assuming high capital substitutability, we find large effects of these policies. Bank exit policies negatively affect both the financing and operation of coal assets. Substitution to other sources and providers of capital appears to be limited. Coal power plants owned by firms exposed to exit policies are more likely to retire, translating into lower CO2 emissions. Exit policies have reduced CO2e emissions from energy production by an estimated 0.62 gigaton.

我们以银行退出煤炭业务政策为实验场景，研究金融机构的退出政策是否会对目标企业产生金融及实体影响。与“资本可高度替代”的理论假设相反，我们发现这类政策效应显著：银行退出政策同时冲击了煤炭资产的融资与运营，且来自其他资金来源或主体的替代极为有限。受退出政策波及的燃煤电厂更易提前退役，进而带动 CO₂ 排放下降。据估算，退出政策已使能源生产的 CO₂e 排放累计减少约 6.2 亿吨。

### Responsible investing: Costs and benefits for university endowment funds
负责任投资：大学捐赠基金的成本与收益

We examine the adoption rates of responsible investment (RI) policies among university endowments. Adoption rates are higher among universities that face stakeholder pressure and are donation-dependent. Policy adoption predicts greater abnormal donations totaling 12 % of endowment assets, especially from “socially conscious” donors and during periods of higher media attention to climate change. Universities also experience greater student applications following adoptions. RI endowments have greater management costs, greater return volatility, and similar overall asset growth (donations plus net-of-cost investment income) compared to non-RI endowments. We conclude that RI policies are an important part of the optimal contract between universities and their stakeholders.

我们研究了大学捐赠基金采用负责任投资（RI）政策的比率。采用率在面对利益相关者压力且依赖捐赠的大学中更高。政策采用可带来约等于捐赠资产12%的异常捐赠增长，尤其来自“具有社会意识”的捐赠者，并在气候变化受到媒体高度关注期间效果更显著。采用RI政策后，大学的申请人数也有所增加。相比未采用RI的捐赠基金，RI捐赠基金的管理成本更高、回报波动更大，但总体资产增长（捐赠加上扣除成本后的投资收益）相近。我们得出结论：RI政策是大学与其利益相关者之间最优合约的重要组成部分。

### Why does options market information predict stock returns?
为什么期权市场信息能预测股票收益？

Several influential studies show that transformations of implied volatilities calculated from options prices predict stock returns. This predictability is puzzling because market participants readily observe options prices. We find that this predictability is consistent with implied volatilities reflecting stock borrow fees that are known to predict stock returns. We derive a formula relating the option-implied volatility spread to the borrow fee. Motivated by this relation, we show that the return predictability from implied volatility spread and skew decreases by at least two-thirds if high-fee stocks are excluded. The patterns for other predictors computed from option implied volatilities are similar.

多项颇具影响力的研究表明，由期权价格计算得出的隐含波动率的若干转换指标能够预测股票收益。这种可预测性令人费解，因为期权价格是市场参与者随时可以观察到的公开信息。我们发现，这种可预测性与隐含波动率反映了已知的能够预测股票收益的“股票借券费用”相一致。我们推导出一个公式，将期权的隐含波动率价差与借券费用联系起来。基于这一关系，我们发现，如果剔除借券费用较高的股票，由隐含波动率价差和偏度所带来的收益可预测性至少降低三分之二。对于其他由期权隐含波动率计算得出的预测指标，其模式也类似。

### Social preferences and corporate investment
社会偏好与企业投资

This paper presents a framework to study how investors’ social concerns affect technology choices. Consequentialist preferences (disutility from aggregate harm) influence outcomes only if investors coordinate, unless internalized harm is independent of an investor’s mass. Non-consequentialist preferences (disutility from stockholdings) affect outcomes regardless of coordination. Both preferences have stronger impact when risk-sharing consequences of technology supply are small (e.g., highly correlated returns), and their effects cannot be inferred from cost-of-capital differences. When harm is stochastic, polluting firms may appear less risky to social investors. Depending on type and strength of social preferences, this can support or hinder the green transition.

本文提出一个框架，研究投资者的社会关切如何影响技术选择。只有当投资者相互协调，或者某一投资者所占份额对总体损害无影响时，结果主义偏好（对总体损害的负效用）才会影响结果；而非结果主义偏好（对持股本身的负效用）无论是否协调都会产生影响。当技术供给的风险分担后果较小时（例如收益高度相关），两种偏好的影响都更强，且其效果无法通过资本成本差异推断。当损害具有随机性时，污染企业对社会投资者可能显得风险更低。根据社会偏好的类型和强度，这一机制既可能推动也可能阻碍绿色转型。

### The financial consequences of undiagnosed memory disorders
未确诊记忆障碍的财务后果

We examine the effect of undiagnosed memory disorders on credit outcomes using individually-matched nationally representative credit reporting and Medicare data. We find effects of early stage disease, years before diagnosis, on a wide range of financial outcomes, including credit card account payment delinquency and amount of delinquent balance, credit utilization among credit card account holders, mortgage delinquency and delinquent balance amount, and credit scores. Effects are pervasive, affecting seniors in single and coupled households, racial/ethnic minorities and non-minorities, and older adults living in areas with higher and lower education levels. Early stage effects are greater among singles and Black individuals.

我们利用个体层面匹配的、具有全国代表性的征信与 Medicare 数据，考察未确诊记忆障碍对信贷结果的影响。在确诊前数年、疾病尚处早期阶段时，已能观察到一系列财务指标显著恶化：信用卡还款逾期率及逾期金额、持卡人的信用利用率、房贷逾期率及逾期余额、以及信用评分。这些影响覆盖面极广，无论单身或与配偶同住、少数族裔或非少数族裔、高教育或低教育地区的长者均受波及；其中，单身人群和黑人长者在早期受到的财务冲击更大。

### Stealthy shorts: Informed liquidity supply
隐形空头：知情流动性供给

Short sellers are widely known to be informed, which would typically suggest that they demand liquidity. We obtain comprehensive transaction-level data to decompose daily short volume into liquidity-demanding and liquidity-supplying components. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we show that the most informed short sellers are actually liquidity suppliers, not liquidity demanders. They are particularly informative about future returns on news days and trade on prominent cross-sectional return anomalies. Our analysis suggests that market making and opportunistic risk-bearing are unlikely to explain these findings. Instead, our results align with recent market microstructure theory, pointing to strategic liquidity provision by informed traders.

人们普遍认为空头掌握信息，因而会“索取”流动性。我们利用逐笔成交数据，把每日融券卖出量分解为“索取”与“供给”两部分。与传统认知相反，最具信息含量的空头其实是流动性“供给方”，而非需求方。他们在新闻日发布的信息对未来收益最具预测力，且交易集中于显著的横截面收益异象。排除做市商行为与机会性风险承担等解释后，结果与最新市场微观结构理论一致：知情交易者通过策略性地提供流动性来获利。

### Maximal extractable value and allocative inefficiencies in public blockchains
公共区块链中的最大可提取价值与配置低效

The blockchain settlement layer facilitates systematic frontrunning, resulting in inefficient block-space allocation. Private transaction pools can reduce these inefficiencies and enhance welfare. However, full adoption is limited by misaligned incentives between users and validators. Validators are reluctant to forgo rents they earn from frontrunning – referred to as maximal extractable value – leading to a partial adoption equilibrium in which frontrunning persists. Our empirical analysis of Ethereum’s Flashbots private pool supports these findings: validators earn higher revenues, users facing greater frontrunning risk are more likely to use the private pool, and attackers’ cost-to-revenue ratios in private pools converge to one.

区块链结算层助长了系统性“抢跑”，导致区块空间配置低效。私有交易池可缓解这一低效并提升福利，但全面推广受限于用户与验证者之间的激励错位：验证者不愿放弃通过抢跑获得的“最大可提取价值”（MEV），从而出现“部分采用”均衡，抢跑依旧存在。对以太坊 Flashbots 私有池的实证分析验证了这一结论：验证者收入更高；面临抢跑风险越大的用户越倾向于使用私有池；私有池中攻击者的成本收益比趋于 1。

### Main Street’s Pain, Wall Street’s Gain
主街之痛，华尔街之利

We propose a fiscal policy expectations mechanism. When bad macro news arrives (in our study, when initial jobless claims (IJC) are higher than expected), investors may expect more generous government spending and drive up aggregate stock prices through the expected cash flow channel. Using a time-series sample from January 2013 to March 2021, we find that this phenomenon emerges when newspapers mention fiscal policy more. In the cross section, firms expected to receive more government spending – through stimulus supports during COVID-19 or procurement contracts before 2020 – exhibit higher individual stock returns when bad IJC shocks arrive.

我们提出了一种财政政策预期机制。当宏观经济坏消息传来时（在我们的研究中，表现为初请失业金人数（IJC）高于预期），投资者可能预期政府将增加支出，并通过预期现金流渠道推高整体股价。利用 2013 年 1 月至 2021 年 3 月的时间序列样本，我们发现，当报纸更多提及财政政策时，这一现象更为显著。从横截面来看，在遭遇负面初请失业金人数冲击时，预期将获得更多政府支出的企业（如新冠疫情期间获得刺激支持的企业，或 2020 年前签订政府采购合同的企业），其个股回报率更高。

### Can everyone tap into the housing piggy bank? Racial disparities in access to home equity
所有人都能动用住房 “储蓄罐” 吗？住房权益获取中的种族差异

We document large racial disparities in the ability of homeowners to access their accumulated housing wealth. Minority homeowners are significantly more likely to have their mortgage equity withdrawal (MEW) product applications rejected than White homeowners, and the unconditional disparities are significantly larger than those found in prior studies that focused on purchase and rate/term refinance loans. Had Black homeowners faced the same MEW denial rate as White homeowners in our sample period we show they would have extracted an additional $11.2 billion in housing equity, or almost 25% of the total amount of actual equity extracted. Controlling for key underwriting variables significantly narrows the racial disparities, with the Black–White gap falling by nearly 85%, and the Hispanic-White gap falling by more than 75%. Credit scores and debt-to-income ratios are the most important factors explaining the gaps, while differences in loan-to-value ratios contribute only modestly. “Residual” disparities after conditioning on observable underwriting factors are large and vary significantly across lenders. A battery of tests suggests that differences in unobserved underwriting factors are unlikely to fully explain the residual disparities, which tend to be larger in geographic areas characterized by more racial animus.

我们发现，房主在动用其积累的住房财富的能力上存在显著的种族差异。少数族裔房主的抵押贷款权益提取（MEW）产品申请被拒的可能性远高于白人房主，且无条件差异比以往聚焦于购房贷款和利率 / 期限再融资贷款的研究中发现的差异要大得多。在我们的样本期内，若黑人房主面临与白人房主相同的 MEW 拒贷率，他们本可多提取 112 亿美元的住房权益，这几乎相当于实际提取权益总额的 25%。控制关键承保变量后，种族差异显著缩小 —— 黑人与白人的差距下降近 85%，西班牙裔与白人的差距下降超 75%。信用评分和债务收入比是解释差距的最重要因素，而贷款价值比的差异贡献较小。在控制可观测承保因素后，“剩余差异” 仍然很大，且在不同贷款机构间差异显著。一系列测试表明，未观测到的承保因素差异不太可能完全解释这些剩余差异，而在种族敌意较严重的地理区域，这些剩余差异往往更大。

### Investor demand, firm investment, and capital misallocation

Fluctuations in investor demand significantly affect firms’ valuation and access to capital. To quantify their real effects, we develop a dynamic investment model, incorporating both the demand and supply sides of capital. Strong investor demand relaxes financial constraints and facilitates equity issuance and investment, while weak demand encourages opportunistic share repurchases, crowding out investment. We estimate the model using indirect inference, matching the endogenous relationship between investor demand and firm policies. Our estimation reveals that demand fluctuations are important drivers of firm-level investment and economy-wide capital misallocation, accounting for 26.9% of dispersion in MPK and 23.4% of productivity losses.

投资者需求、企业投资与资本配置失当

投资者需求的波动会显著影响企业估值和资本获取能力。为量化其实际影响，我们构建了一个纳入资本需求侧与供给侧因素的动态投资模型。强劲的投资者需求会缓解企业财务约束，促进股权发行和投资；而需求疲软则会催生机会主义股票回购，挤出投资。我们运用间接推断法对模型进行估计，匹配投资者需求与企业政策之间的内生关系。估计结果显示，需求波动是企业层面投资和整体经济资本配置失当的重要驱动因素，可解释 26.9% 的资本边际产量（MPK）离散度和 23.4% 的生产率损失。
