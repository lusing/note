### Main Street’s Pain, Wall Street’s Gain
主街之痛，华尔街之利

We propose a fiscal policy expectations mechanism. When bad macro news arrives (in our study, when initial jobless claims (IJC) are higher than expected), investors may expect more generous government spending and drive up aggregate stock prices through the expected cash flow channel. Using a time-series sample from January 2013 to March 2021, we find that this phenomenon emerges when newspapers mention fiscal policy more. In the cross section, firms expected to receive more government spending – through stimulus supports during COVID-19 or procurement contracts before 2020 – exhibit higher individual stock returns when bad IJC shocks arrive.

我们提出了一种财政政策预期机制。当宏观经济坏消息传来时（在我们的研究中，表现为初请失业金人数（IJC）高于预期），投资者可能预期政府将增加支出，并通过预期现金流渠道推高整体股价。利用 2013 年 1 月至 2021 年 3 月的时间序列样本，我们发现，当报纸更多提及财政政策时，这一现象更为显著。从横截面来看，在遭遇负面初请失业金人数冲击时，预期将获得更多政府支出的企业（如新冠疫情期间获得刺激支持的企业，或 2020 年前签订政府采购合同的企业），其个股回报率更高。

### Can everyone tap into the housing piggy bank? Racial disparities in access to home equity
所有人都能动用住房 “储蓄罐” 吗？住房权益获取中的种族差异

We document large racial disparities in the ability of homeowners to access their accumulated housing wealth. Minority homeowners are significantly more likely to have their mortgage equity withdrawal (MEW) product applications rejected than White homeowners, and the unconditional disparities are significantly larger than those found in prior studies that focused on purchase and rate/term refinance loans. Had Black homeowners faced the same MEW denial rate as White homeowners in our sample period we show they would have extracted an additional $11.2 billion in housing equity, or almost 25% of the total amount of actual equity extracted. Controlling for key underwriting variables significantly narrows the racial disparities, with the Black–White gap falling by nearly 85%, and the Hispanic-White gap falling by more than 75%. Credit scores and debt-to-income ratios are the most important factors explaining the gaps, while differences in loan-to-value ratios contribute only modestly. “Residual” disparities after conditioning on observable underwriting factors are large and vary significantly across lenders. A battery of tests suggests that differences in unobserved underwriting factors are unlikely to fully explain the residual disparities, which tend to be larger in geographic areas characterized by more racial animus.

我们发现，房主在动用其积累的住房财富的能力上存在显著的种族差异。少数族裔房主的抵押贷款权益提取（MEW）产品申请被拒的可能性远高于白人房主，且无条件差异比以往聚焦于购房贷款和利率 / 期限再融资贷款的研究中发现的差异要大得多。在我们的样本期内，若黑人房主面临与白人房主相同的 MEW 拒贷率，他们本可多提取 112 亿美元的住房权益，这几乎相当于实际提取权益总额的 25%。控制关键承保变量后，种族差异显著缩小 —— 黑人与白人的差距下降近 85%，西班牙裔与白人的差距下降超 75%。信用评分和债务收入比是解释差距的最重要因素，而贷款价值比的差异贡献较小。在控制可观测承保因素后，“剩余差异” 仍然很大，且在不同贷款机构间差异显著。一系列测试表明，未观测到的承保因素差异不太可能完全解释这些剩余差异，而在种族敌意较严重的地理区域，这些剩余差异往往更大。

### Investor demand, firm investment, and capital misallocation

Fluctuations in investor demand significantly affect firms’ valuation and access to capital. To quantify their real effects, we develop a dynamic investment model, incorporating both the demand and supply sides of capital. Strong investor demand relaxes financial constraints and facilitates equity issuance and investment, while weak demand encourages opportunistic share repurchases, crowding out investment. We estimate the model using indirect inference, matching the endogenous relationship between investor demand and firm policies. Our estimation reveals that demand fluctuations are important drivers of firm-level investment and economy-wide capital misallocation, accounting for 26.9% of dispersion in MPK and 23.4% of productivity losses.

投资者需求、企业投资与资本配置失当

投资者需求的波动会显著影响企业估值和资本获取能力。为量化其实际影响，我们构建了一个纳入资本需求侧与供给侧因素的动态投资模型。强劲的投资者需求会缓解企业财务约束，促进股权发行和投资；而需求疲软则会催生机会主义股票回购，挤出投资。我们运用间接推断法对模型进行估计，匹配投资者需求与企业政策之间的内生关系。估计结果显示，需求波动是企业层面投资和整体经济资本配置失当的重要驱动因素，可解释 26.9% 的资本边际产量（MPK）离散度和 23.4% 的生产率损失。
