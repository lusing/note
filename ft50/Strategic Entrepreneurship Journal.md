#### Innovation Under Pressure

在压力下创新

Firms become more efficient at innovation activities when they face pressure to meet earnings per share (EPS) targets using stock repurchases. Using a regression-discontinuity framework, we find that incentives to engage in “EPS-motivated buybacks” are followed by more citations and higher values for firms’ new patents. We trace these effects to improved allocation of R&D resources and a greater focus on novel innovation. The positive effects are concentrated among ex ante “innovation-efficient” firms that achieve better patenting outcomes after reorganizing (but not cutting) their R&D investments. Our findings illustrate that short-term earnings pressure can act through a free cash flow channel that motivates more efficient spending.

当企业面临通过股票回购实现每股收益（EPS）目标的压力时，其创新活动会变得更为高效。我们采用断点回归框架发现，在“EPS驱动型回购”激励出现后，企业新增专利的引用量和市场价值均显著提升。进一步追溯发现，这一效应源于研发资源配置的优化以及对突破性创新的更聚焦。积极效应主要集中在事前“创新高效”的企业群体中——这些企业在重组（而非削减）研发投资后取得了更优的专利成果。我们的研究表明，短期盈利压力可通过自由现金流渠道发挥作用，促使企业实现更高效的支出。
