### Getting the Board on Board: Marketing Department Power and Board Interlocks
让董事会参与进来：营销部门的权力与董事会交错关系

Although the power held by the marketing department can determine key organizational outcomes, including firm performance, this power seemingly has been decreasing. To address this apparent disconnect, the authors propose that the board of directors is a critical but overlooked antecedent of marketing department power (MDP). In particular, the authors demonstrate that directors’ exposure through board service at other firms (i.e., board interlocks) affects MDP in the firms on whose boards they also serve (i.e., focal firms). A sample of 6,008 firms, spanning 2007C2021, reveals that MDP in board-interlocked firms has a positive effect on MDP in focal firms. Despite evidence that board interlock effects have diminished or even disappeared, the findings suggest the board interlock effect remains a potent antecedent of MDP―and this effect did not decrease during the observation period. Adapting the 3R (reachCrichnessCreceptivity) framework, the authors also find that the board interlock effect increases with greater reach and richness of a focal firm's board interlock network and its executives’ receptivity to information. The marketing department's decreasing power is concerning for the discipline; the robust results of this study suggest that firms need to get the board “on board” to stem this diminishing trend.

尽管营销部门所拥有的权力可以决定包括公司绩效在内的关键组织结果，但这种权力似乎在逐渐减弱。为了解决这一明显的脱节问题，作者提出董事会是营销部门权力（MDP）的一个关键但被忽视的前因。特别是，作者们展示了董事在其他公司董事会服务中的接触（即董事会交错关系）如何影响他们在其服务的焦点公司中的MDP。通过对2007年至2021年间6,008家公司的样本分析发现，具有董事会交错关系的公司在MDP方面对焦点公司有正面影响。尽管有证据表明董事会交错关系的影响已经减弱甚至消失，但研究结果表明，董事会交错关系仍然是MDP的一个强有力的前因――并且这种影响在观察期内并未减少。

采用3R（覆盖范围-丰富度-接受度）框架，作者还发现，当焦点公司的董事会交错关系网络及其高管对信息的接受度具有更大的覆盖范围和丰富度时，董事会交错关系效应会增强。营销部门权力的下降对于该领域来说是一个令人担忧的问题；本研究的强有力结果表明，公司需要让董事会“参与进来”以遏制这一下降趋势。

具体来说，这项研究表明：

董事会交错关系的重要性：董事在其他公司董事会的服务经历能够提升他们所在焦点公司的营销部门权力。
持续的影响：即使在某些情况下董事会交错关系的影响有所减弱，但其对MDP的正面作用依然显著，并未随时间推移而减少。
3R框架的应用：董事会交错关系网络的覆盖范围、丰富度以及高管的信息接受度越高，这种正面影响越强。
这些发现为企业提供了重要的策略指导，帮助它们通过加强董事会的参与和支持来提升营销部门的权力和整体表现。

### Sharing to Persuade: The Role of Donor- Versus Charity-Focused Word of Mouth
通过分享来劝说：捐赠者 vs. 慈善机构为中心的口碑传播的作用

Charitable organizations are increasingly soliciting donors to engage in word of mouth (WOM) as a strategy to foster future contributions. While some organizations encourage donors to share WOM that focuses on their own donations (donor-focused WOM; e.g., “I just donated to the kids of @StJude. Join me in saving children's lives.”), others prompt donors to share WOM that focuses on the organization itself (charity-focused WOM; e.g., “Smile Train gives children with clefts the #PowerOfASmile.”). Contrary to the common belief that people mostly want to talk about themselves, the current research demonstrates that donor-focused WOM backfires, such that donors are less likely to share donor- than charity-focused WOM. This effect is driven by their belief that donor-focused WOM is less altruistic and is therefore less efficacious in persuading others to contribute to the same cause. In addition to sharing, the type of WOM solicited exerts far-reaching impact, with donor-focused WOM attracting fewer new donors than charity-focused WOM. The current research improves the understanding of WOM type, its effect, and the underlying processes.

慈善组织越来越多地鼓励捐赠者进行口碑传播（WOM）以促进未来的捐款。一些组织鼓励捐赠者分享以自己捐款为中心的口碑（捐赠者为中心的WOM；例如：“我刚刚为@StJude的孩子们捐了款。加入我，一起拯救孩子们的生命。”），而另一些组织则引导捐赠者分享以组织本身为中心的口碑（慈善机构为中心的WOM；例如：“Smile Train赋予唇腭裂儿童#微笑的力量。”）。与普遍认为人们更愿意谈论自己的观点相反，当前的研究表明，以捐赠者为中心的口碑反而适得其反，即捐赠者分享以自己为中心的口碑的可能性低于以慈善机构为中心的口碑。

这种效应是由他们的信念驱动的，即认为以捐赠者为中心的口碑显得不够无私，因此在说服他人对同一事业做出贡献方面效果较差。除了分享行为本身，所征求的口碑类型还具有深远的影响，以捐赠者为中心的口碑吸引的新捐赠者少于以慈善机构为中心的口碑。

当前的研究增进了对不同类型的口碑传播、其效果以及潜在过程的理解。具体来说：

捐赠者 vs. 慈善机构为中心的口碑：研究表明，尽管人们通常被认为更愿意谈论自己，但在慈善捐赠的情境下，捐赠者更倾向于分享以慈善机构为中心的口碑。
背后的原因：捐赠者认为以自己为中心的口碑显得不够无私，因此在说服他人捐赠时效果较差。
实际影响：以捐赠者为中心的口碑不仅分享率较低，而且吸引的新捐赠者也较少，相比之下，以慈善机构为中心的口碑更为有效。
这些发现为企业和慈善组织提供了重要的策略指导，帮助它们更有效地设计和实施口碑传播活动，以最大化捐赠者的参与度和新捐赠者的获取。

### Designing Quality Certificates: Insights from eBay
设计质量认证：来自eBay的见解

Quality certification is a common tool to enhance trust in marketplaces. Should the certification be based on consumer reports, such as ratings, or administrative data on seller behavior, such as the number of seller-initiated cancellations? In theory, incorporating consumer reports makes the quality certificate more relevant for consumer experience but may discourage seller effort, because consumer reports can be driven by factors not entirely within sellers’ control. Alternatively, using administrative data makes the certification more controllable by sellers, but these data track only a subset of seller behavior and may not be fully aligned with consumer experience. To answer the preceding question, the authors study a major redesign of eBay's quality certification that removed most consumer reports from its criteria and added administrative data. This change motivates seller effort in dimensions highlighted by the new criteria, as well as enabling sellers to more precisely target their effort at the threshold. Buyers place a higher value on the quality certificate and are more likely to purchase again on the platform in markets where administrative data are more correlated with consumer reports. Last, the proportion of certified sellers becomes more homogenized across markets, and sales seem to become more concentrated toward large sellers.

质量认证是增强市场信任的常用工具。认证应该基于消费者报告（如评分）还是基于卖家行为的管理数据（如卖家发起的取消次数）？理论上，纳入消费者报告可以使质量认证更贴合消费者的体验，但可能会打击卖家的努力，因为消费者报告可能受到卖家无法完全控制的因素影响。另一方面，使用管理数据使认证更易于卖家控制，但这些数据仅跟踪卖家行为的一部分，可能与消费者体验不完全一致。

为了解答上述问题，作者研究了eBay对其质量认证的重大 redesign（重新设计），该重新设计移除了大部分消费者报告，并增加了管理数据。这一变化激励卖家在新标准强调的维度上更加努力，并使卖家能够更精确地针对认证门槛进行努力。在管理数据与消费者报告相关性更高的市场中，买家对质量认证的评价更高，并且更有可能再次在平台上购买商品。

最后，认证卖家的比例在各市场之间变得更加均匀，销售似乎也更加集中在大型卖家手中。

具体来说，这项研究揭示了几点关键发现：

认证标准的选择：将消费者报告替换为管理数据后，质量认证更能激励卖家在特定维度上的努力，并使他们能够更精准地针对认证标准。
买家反应：当管理数据与消费者报告的相关性较高时，买家对质量认证的信任度更高，更愿意再次购买。
市场均衡：认证卖家的比例在不同市场之间变得更加均衡，同时销售更多地集中在大型卖家身上。
这些发现为企业和平台提供了重要的策略指导，帮助它们更好地设计和实施质量认证机制，以提升市场信任并优化卖家和买家的行为。通过选择合适的认证标准，平台可以更好地平衡卖家的努力和买家的信任，从而促进市场的健康发展。

### The Rank Length Effect

Rank lists vary in the number of items ranked on the list (e.g., top 5 vs. top 20 movies on IMDb), that is, the rank length. Across ten studies, including both field and laboratory experiments, the authors examine the influence of rank length on evaluations, willingness to pay, and choice. They document a novel rank length effect: The same ranked items elicit more positive judgments when the rank length is longer (vs. shorter), although the differences in judgments between the ranked items are smaller. This effect is driven both by consumers’ tendency to narrowly focus on the rank list and by the manner in which they map the rank list onto their mental number line. The rank length effect extends to willingness to pay, and choice. The authors explore three different kinds of choice contexts, discuss implications, and offer suggestions for future research.

### The Closing-the-Gap Effect: Joint Evaluation Leads Donors to Help Charities Farther from Their Goal

Charitable donations can be influenced by the level of progress a cause has made toward its fundraising goal. The current work demonstrates how jointly considering more than one charitable cause along with their goal progress information shifts consumers’ donation decisions. When charitable causes are evaluated jointly (vs. separately), the comparison makes relative need for help more salient and easier to evaluate, leading to greater giving to the cause farther from its goal. A multimethod investigation, involving six preregistered experimental studies, seven supplemental studies, and a large secondary dataset with over 10,000 projects from a micro-crowdfunding platform, provides evidence for this phenomenon and demonstrates that it is robust to variations in the type of cause, the number of projects, and the donor being able to personally complete the goal. Conversely, the effect is eliminated or reversed when charities are evaluated separately (as relative need for help is less salient), when the gap between charities is smaller (as perceptions of relative need for help are diminished), or when for-profit businesses are evaluated (as the context does not heighten sensitivity to need). This work contributes to research on goal progress and evaluation mode and has implications for charitable giving in comparative contexts like crowdfunding.

### Referral Contagion: Downstream Benefits of Customer Referrals

Companies often invest in referral reward programs to incentivize their current customers to spread word of mouth. Previous work has documented that referred customers tend to be more valuable than nonreferred customers through their purchases or engagement with the company. The authors propose a previously overlooked benefit of encouraging referrals: Referred customers are also more valuable because they make more referrals. Using a large-scale field dataset, the authors show that referred customers make 31%C57% more referrals than nonreferred customers conditional on purchase activities. Using preregistered lab experiments, they replicate the main effect and propose one underlying mechanism: Referred customers perceive referring to be more socially appropriate than nonreferred customers do. In a field experiment, the authors build on previous work on norm salience and show that reminding referred customers that they joined through a referral further boosts their referral likelihood by 21%. These results advance the understanding of the social motives that contribute to referral decisions and illustrate that promoting referrals is substantially more valuable than previously estimated.

### Past Imperfect or Present Perfect? How Dynamic Ranks Influence Consumer Perceptions

While ranked lists are ubiquitous, research on how consumers interpret changes in the rank of an entity is limited. Across seven studies (including a study with web data and a Google AdWords field experiment), this investigation shows that consumers reward a rise in rank and penalize a decline in rank, and that psychological momentum associated with the rank change information underlies these effects. Further, rewarding a rise and penalizing a fall are moderated by consumers’ perception of the reason for the rank change, the nature of the entity, and the nature of the ranked list. The impact of changing rank is attenuated when the rank change is attributed to other entities on the list, when entities are considered nonmalleable, or when the list is updated more frequently. The investigation also identifies a specific case in which consumers do not extrapolate the direction of a change in rank into the future. In addition to contributing to theory, this research provides actionable insights and demonstrates practical ways in which managers can communicate dynamic ranks to enhance the benefit of an improvement in rank or attenuate the penalty from a decline.

### Wait for Free: A Consumption-Decelerating Promotion for Serialized Digital Media

Promotions for digital goods have typically focused on enticing users to hasten their consumption. Here, the authors investigate a novel deceleration-incentivizing promotional policy, “wait for free” (WFF), applied to serialized digital content―sequences of interconnected episodes―monetized via episode-level paywalls. Specifically, customers can sample early episodes of promoted series for free, and can continue to watch for free by waiting a prespecified time; those unwilling to wait can pay to view episodes right away. WFF can draw users to start viewing a promoted series, and it generates revenue through two sources: impatient users opting to pay to consume the next episode immediately, and additional users continuing through the free episodes to watch paid-only episodes at the end. The authors analyze large-scale viewership data from a platform that enacted WFF for digital comics. A comic-level difference-in-differences analysis provides robust evidence that WFF boosts paid viewership for the promoted series, and the degree of lift varies by user type and over time. A more granular episode-level analysis incorporating intercomic spillovers and promotional lift heterogeneity suggests that WFF can boost net-of-cannibalization revenue at the platform level: Specifically, the model-optimized set of promoted comics performs roughly 18% better than the firm-enacted one and 25% better than the no-promotion baseline; furthermore, WFF and paid-only episodes each receive nontrivial degrees of lift, 70% and 59% respectively.

### How Insurance Prices Affect Consumers’ Purchase Decisions: Insurance Price as a Risk Signal

Retailers, service providers, and manufacturers have discovered that complementary optional insurance is an attractive source of profit and frequently charge substantial insurance prices compared with the price of the product to be insured. The implicit assumption behind this pricing strategy is that product purchase decisions are independent of the insurance offer. The authors question this assumption and propose that consumers interpret the price of insurance as a risk signal with respect to the underlying product. Perceived risk, in turn, negatively affects consumers’ decision to purchase the product in a given purchase situation. The results of a survey, three online experiments, and two studies using transactional data provide evidence for the proposed insurance price risk signal. The findings reveal that perceived risk mediates the link between the relative insurance price level and consumers’ decision to purchase the underlying product. Offering other optional add-ons and providing objective risk information weakens the insurance price risk signal.

### Zooming In on the Very Early Days: The Role of Trademark Applications in the Acquisition of Venture Capital Seed Funding

New ventures are essential for developing innovations and generating economic and societal value, but they depend on external resources, especially from venture capitalists, who provide seed funding to make necessary advances in the development and commercialization of their innovative products. From the marketing discipline's perspective, the question is whether marketing actions play a role in this early acquisition of critical resources. Building on organizational legitimacy theory, the authors argue that trademark applications are important from day one, as they send important information cues to venture capitalists (e.g., on marketing-related professionalism) that foster the acquisition of venture capital (VC) seed funding. The authors build a dataset using Crunchbase and U.S. Patent and Trademark Office data that follows 5,370 ventures founded between 2007 and 2010 over several years up to 2018. They find that new ventures that file trademark applications have an increased likelihood of acquiring VC seed funding compared with firms that do not file trademark applications. This association is strongest during the first 100 days and diminishes about 1,000 days after foundation. The effect is particularly pronounced in industries characterized by low technological uncertainty and when new ventures do not operate from a location with a cluster of startups, such as Silicon Valley.
