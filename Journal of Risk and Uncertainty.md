### Fast and slow dynamic decision making under ambiguity
模糊性下的快速与慢速动态决策

Different people think in different ways, and their behaviour can be analysed in different ways. In this paper, we analyse the correlation between the type of behaviour and the time taken to reach a decision in a dynamic context and under ambiguity with different monetary incentives, linking the results with fast and slow thinking processes. Four different types of dynamic decision-makers are identified: Resolute, Myopic, Sophisticated, and Expected Utility (EU). The different types use different methods to solve dynamic problems: A Resolute decision-maker (DM) decides right at the beginning his or her strategy, a Myopic DM simplifies the problem by ignoring part of it, a Sophisticated DM works by backward induction, and an EU DM either works by backward induction or by using the Strategy Method. We use data from (Caferra et al., 2023) where subjects were asked to solve a two-stage dynamic allocation problem. In that experiment, there were two treatments, incentivised and unincentivised. We found that their type matters: EU subjects take more time to solve the ambiguity, showing a relationship between dynamic consistency and ambiguity-neutrality with a deliberative thinking process. We also found that subjects in the non-incentivised treatment take less time, indicating that monetary incentives matter. The gap between the probabilities at each stage appears to be a good predictor of uncertainty for uncertainty averse subjects: the higher is the gap, the clearer is the most probable event and the lower is the time subjects spend to solve the decision problem.

不同的人思维方式不同，其行为也可通过不同方式分析。在本文中，我们分析了动态情境和模糊性下，不同金钱激励对行为类型与决策耗时的相关性，并将结果与快速和慢速思维过程相联系。研究识别出四种不同类型的动态决策者：果断型（Resolute）、短视型（Myopic）、老练型（Sophisticated）和期望效用型（Expected Utility, EU）。不同类型的决策者采用不同方法解决动态问题：果断型决策者（DM）从一开始就确定策略，短视型决策者通过忽略部分问题简化任务，老练型决策者运用逆向归纳法，而期望效用型决策者则可能使用逆向归纳法或策略法（Strategy Method）。
我们使用了（Caferra 等人，2023）的实验数据，该研究要求受试者解决两阶段动态分配问题。实验设置了两种处理条件：有激励和无激励。结果表明，决策者类型至关重要：期望效用型受试者花费更多时间解决模糊性问题，这显示了动态一致性和模糊中性与审慎思维过程的关联。我们还发现，无激励处理中的受试者耗时更短，表明金钱激励会影响决策时间。对于厌恶不确定性的受试者，各阶段概率之间的差距似乎是不确定性的良好预测指标：差距越大，最可能事件越明确，受试者解决决策问题的时间越少。

### Improving risky choices: The effect of cognitive offloading on risky decisions
改善风险选择：认知卸载对风险决策的影响

Economic choices are difficult and computationally complex. To make good decisions one needs to integrate different variables and resolve several trade-offs. We study whether providing external tools which help reducing the computational complexity of choices improves risky decisions. We find mixed evidence for the effectiveness of these tools, as people tend to rarely use them. Overall, cognitive offloading tools make people less risk averse and better at updating beliefs, but they do not decrease irrational behavior, in the sense of the proportion of dominated choices, violations of expected utility, and sub-optimal budget allocations. These results suggest that simply providing external tools, which make choices (computationally) easier, but where using these aids is discretional, has a limited impact on improving people’s choices under risk.

经济选择既困难又具有计算复杂性。要做出良好决策，人们需要整合不同变量并解决多个权衡问题。我们研究了提供帮助降低选择计算复杂性的外部工具是否能改善风险决策。研究发现，这些工具的有效性证据参差不齐，因为人们往往很少使用它们。总体而言，认知卸载工具会降低人们的风险厌恶程度，并提高其更新信念的能力，但从占优选择比例、违背期望效用原则以及次优预算分配等角度来看，这些工具并未减少非理性行为。研究结果表明，单纯提供使选择（计算上）更简单但使用与否由个人自由决定的外部工具，对改善人们在风险下的选择影响有限。

### Evaluation of intertemporal streams
跨期收入流评估

Would you rather receive your salary in one paycheck in one month or—one half of it in one month and the other half paid out in slightly more than one month? The first option dominates the second option in terms of first-order temporal dominance. Yet, standard models of intertemporal choice such as discounted utility (also known as constant or exponential discounting), hyperbolic or quasi-hyperbolic discouning with a concave utility function predict a preference for the dominated alternative. This paper presents a minor modification of these standard models to avoid such violations of first-order temporal dominance. Applications to optimal savings and evaluation of a perpetuity are provided.

你更愿意在一个月内一次性收到全额工资，还是 —— 一个月内先收到一半，另一半在稍多于一个月后收到？从一阶时间优势的角度来看，第一种选择占优于第二种选择。然而，标准的跨期选择模型（如折扣效用理论 —— 也称为固定或指数贴现模型，以及具有凹效用函数的双曲或准双曲贴现模型）却预测人们会偏好劣势选项。本文提出对这些标准模型进行微小修正，以避免此类对一阶时间优势的违背，并讨论了该模型在最优储蓄和永续年金评估中的应用。

### An experiment on outcome uncertainty
结果不确定性实验研究

We report the evidence of a multi-stage lab experiment on individual decision making under ambiguity, where the latter is characterized by the (partial or) absence of information on some monetary values in the support of the lottery distributions. This complements the standard treatment of uncertainty where decision makers know the monetary prizes, but probabilities are uncertain. We use both a structural and a non-structural approach when analyzing subjects’ behavior under risk, compound risk, and outcome ambiguity. Our main finding is that subjects are risk-averse and ambiguity lovers in that they evaluate more optimistically uncertain payoffs under ambiguity compared to compound risk. We also study how subjects evaluate scenarios with uncertain outcomes: 60% of choices are consistent with the Expected Utility paradigm, while 40% of them are better described by a heuristic we label as “naïve,” in which the order of integration of Expected Utility is reversed (that is, they first form a point estimate of the uncertain payoffs, and then they evaluate the lotteries’ expected utility). Finally, we also find that risk and ambiguity aversion are positively correlated.

我们报告了一项多阶段实验室实验的证据，该实验考察模糊性下的个体决策行为 —— 此处的模糊性表现为（部分或完全）缺乏对彩票分配中某些货币价值的信息。这补充了标准的不确定性处理情境（即决策者知晓货币奖励但概率不确定的情况）。我们在分析受试者在风险、复合风险和结果模糊性下的行为时，同时采用了结构性和非结构性方法。研究的主要发现是：受试者表现出风险厌恶和模糊性偏好，即与复合风险相比，他们对模糊性下的不确定收益评估更为乐观。我们还研究了受试者如何评估结果不确定的情景：60% 的选择符合期望效用范式，而 40% 的选择更适合用一种我们称为 “幼稚” 启发式策略来解释（即先对不确定收益形成点估计，再评估彩票的期望效用）。最后，我们发现风险厌恶与模糊性厌恶呈正相关。

### True overconfidence, revealed through actions: An experiment
通过行为揭示的真正过度自信：一项实验研究

We design an experiment to infer true overconfidence in relative ability through actions, as opposed to reported beliefs. Subjects choose how to invest earnings from a skill task where the returns depend either solely upon risk, or both risk and relative placement, enabling joint estimation of individual risk preferences and implied subjective beliefs of placing in the top half. We find evidence of aggregate overconfidence only in a treatment that receives minimal feedback on performance in a trial round. In treatments that receive more detailed feedback aggregate overconfidence is not observed, however identifiable segments of over- and underconfident individuals persist.

我们设计了一项实验，通过行为而非自我报告的信念来推断个体在相对能力上的真正过度自信。受试者选择如何投资其在技能任务中获得的收益，其中收益要么仅取决于风险，要么同时取决于风险和相对排名，这使得我们能够联合估计个体的风险偏好以及其隐含的进入前半部分的主观信念。研究发现，只有在试验轮次中仅获得最少表现反馈的处理组中，存在总体过度自信的证据。在获得更详细反馈的处理组中，总体过度自信并未出现，但过度自信和自信不足的可识别群体依然存在。
