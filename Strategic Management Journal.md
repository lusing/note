### Generative artificial intelligence and evaluating strategic decisions​

​生成式人工智能与战略决策评估

Research Summary

Strategic decisions are uncertain and often irreversible. Hence, predicting the value of alternatives is important for strategic decision making. We investigate the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in evaluating strategic alternatives using business models generated by AI (study 1) or submitted to a competition (study 2). Each study uses a sample of 60 business models and examines agreement in business model rankings made by large language models (LLMs) and those by human experts. We consider multiple LLMs, assumed LLM roles, and prompts. We find that generative AI often produces evaluations that are inconsistent and biased. However, when aggregating evaluations, AI rankings tend to resemble those of human experts. This study highlights the value of generative AI in strategic decision making by providing predictions.

研究总结

战略决策往往充满不确定性，且通常是不可逆转的。因此，预测备选方案的价值对于战略决策至关重要。我们研究了生成式人工智能（AI）在评估战略备选方案中的应用，这些方案或是由AI生成的（研究1），或是提交给竞赛的（研究2）。每项研究都选取了60个商业模式样本，并考察了大型语言模型（LLMs）与人类专家在商业模式排名上的一致性。我们考虑了多个LLMs、假设的LLM角色以及提示。我们发现，生成式AI通常会产生不一致且有偏见的评估。然而，当汇总评估结果时，AI的排名往往与人类专家的排名相似。本研究通过提供预测，突显了生成式AI在战略决策中的价值。

Managerial Summary

Managers are seeking to create value by integrating generative AI into their organizations. We show how managers can use generative AI to help evaluate strategic decisions. Generative AI's single evaluations are often inconsistent or biased. However, if managers aggregate many evaluations across LLMs, prompts, or roles, the results show that the resulting evaluations tend to resemble those of human experts. This approach allows managers to obtain insight on strategic decisions across a variety of domains with relatively low investments in time or resources, which can be combined with human inputs.

管理总结

管理者正寻求通过将生成式人工智能整合到其组织中来创造价值。我们展示了管理者如何利用生成式AI来帮助评估战略决策。生成式AI的单一评估往往不一致或有偏见。然而，如果管理者汇总来自不同LLMs、提示或角色的多个评估，结果表明，这些评估结果往往与人类专家的评估相似。这种方法使管理者能够以相对较低的时间或资源投入，在多个领域获得关于战略决策的洞察，这些洞察可以与人类的输入相结合。

### Gender and racial minorities on corporate boards: How board faultlines and CEO-minority director overlap affect firm performance​

​性别和种族少数群体在公司董事会中的作用：董事会分裂线与CEO-少数族裔董事重叠如何影响公司绩效

Research Summary
In this article, we examine the multidimensional and multilevel nature of diversity in the context of corporate boards. Using the concept of faultlines, we argue that when gender and racial background aligns with human capital attributes of board members, faultlines may be formed with negative implications for firm performance. However, the potential negative impact of faultlines can be alleviated by overlaps in the characteristics of the CEO and minority directors. Specifically, we find that higher overlaps in tenure and personal range of functional experiences help overcome some of the disadvantages that minority directors face and moderate the relationship between board faultline strength and firm performance. Empirical tests using 14 years data on 262 firms belonging to S&P500 index largely support our theoretical ideas.

Managerial Summary
Boards often suffer from unhealthy team dynamics. In this article, we explore how alignment of board members' attributes may lead to potential subgroup formation within boards. Specifically, we examine how, under existing pressures to increase demographic diversity on corporate boards, alignment of human capital characteristics with gender and racial minority status may lead to the formation of board faultlines that negatively influence firm performance. Our results suggest that the CEO plays a pivotal role in overcoming negative consequences of board faultlines by utilizing shared tenure on board and common functional experiences with minority board members. Our research suggests that board selection needs to focus beyond scrutinizing individual-level human capital and instead understand alignments of directors' profiles that enable optimal board functioning.

研究总结
在本文中，我们研究了公司董事会背景下多样性的多维度和多层次特征。运用 “断层线” 这一概念，我们认为，当性别和种族背景与董事会成员的人力资本属性相一致时，可能会形成断层线，对公司业绩产生负面影响。然而，首席执行官（CEO）与少数族裔董事之间特征上的重叠可以减轻断层线的潜在负面影响。具体而言，我们发现，在任职期限和个人职能经验范围方面较高的重叠度，有助于克服少数族裔董事所面临的一些劣势，并缓和董事会断层线强度与公司业绩之间的关系。通过对标准普尔 500 指数成分股中 262 家公司 14 年的数据进行实证检验，结果在很大程度上支持了我们的理论观点。
管理总结

董事会常常受到不健康的团队动态的困扰。在本文中，我们探讨了董事会成员属性的一致性如何可能导致董事会内部潜在的小团体形成。具体来说，我们研究了在当前增加公司董事会人口统计学多样性的压力下，人力资本特征与性别和少数族裔身份的一致性，如何可能导致董事会断层线的形成，进而对公司业绩产生负面影响。我们的研究结果表明，首席执行官在克服董事会断层线带来的负面后果方面起着关键作用，其方式是利用与少数族裔董事会成员在董事会任职期限上的共同之处，以及共同的职能经验。我们的研究表明，董事会成员的选拔不应仅仅着眼于仔细审查个人层面的人力资本，而应深入理解董事个人特征的协调性，以实现董事会的最佳运作。

### When colleagues compete outside the firm​

​当同事在公司外竞争时

Research Summary
Collaboration among employees is the bedrock of an organization, but we suggest that it can be undermined by their extra-organizational affiliations. We point to the hidden but common constellation of two coworkers who are also affiliated with organizations that compete with one another. We hypothesize that such colleagues collaborate less with one another when performing on behalf of their shared employer. Using data from professional soccer, we provide empirical evidence. We outline implications for research on extra-organizational affiliations, intraorganizational collaboration, competition and rivalry, and social networks.

Managerial Summary
Imagine two soccer players who play for the same soccer club – but compete against one another when they perform on behalf of their national team (i.e., the two players have different nationalities). We show that the two soccer players collaborate less (i.e., play fewer passes to each other) at their club after encountering each other as opponents when performing on behalf of their national teams. This finding in the context of sports has implications for firms. Managers of the same firm may serve on boards of directors of companies that compete with each other, and employees may support political parties that compete – eventually hindering internal collaboration.

研究总结
员工之间的协作是一个组织的基石，但我们认为，员工的组织外从属关系可能会破坏这种协作。我们关注的是一种隐蔽但常见的情况，即两名同事同时还隶属于相互竞争的其他组织。我们假设，当代表他们共同的雇主开展工作时，这样的同事之间相互协作会更少。通过使用职业足球领域的数据，我们提供了实证依据。我们概述了该研究对于组织外从属关系、组织内协作、竞争与对抗以及社交网络等方面的研究意义。

管理总结
设想有两名足球运动员，他们效力于同一个足球俱乐部，但当他们代表各自的国家队参赛时（即这两名球员国籍不同）却彼此竞争。我们的研究表明，这两名足球运动员在代表各自国家队作为对手交锋之后，在俱乐部里相互之间的协作会减少（即彼此之间的传球次数变少）。这一在体育领域的发现对企业也有启示意义。同一家公司的经理们可能会在相互竞争的其他公司的董事会任职，员工们可能会支持相互竞争的不同政党，这些最终都会阻碍公司内部的协作。

### ​What keeps the market ticking? The role of third-party audiences and cognitive embeddedness in shaping competitive dynamics in luxury watchmaking​
​是什么推动市场运转？第三方观众与认知嵌入在奢侈手表制造业竞争动态中的作用

Research Summary
Competitive dynamics between firms and buyers are shaped by mutually understood conceptual systems that enable market interactions. Third-party audiences, such as the media, play a crucial role in shaping market structure and evolution by facilitating the development of these conceptual systems. Although they do not directly engage in contractual bargaining, third-party audiences stabilize perceptions and facilitate market interactions by cognitively embedding competitive dynamics. Our study examines the coreness of firms within the semantic network of firm names as relayed by the media. We find that higher coreness positively impacts auction prices. This effect is moderated by firm visibility and the tone of media coverage. Our model is tested using a unique dataset from the luxury watchmaking industry.

研究总结
企业与买家之间的竞争动态是由双方都能理解的概念体系所塑造的，这些概念体系促成了市场互动。像媒体这样的第三方受众，通过推动这些概念体系的发展，在塑造市场结构和演变过程中发挥着至关重要的作用。尽管第三方受众并不直接参与合同谈判，但它们通过在认知层面嵌入竞争动态，稳定了各方的认知，并促进了市场互动。我们的研究考察了在媒体所传播的企业名称语义网络中企业的核心地位。我们发现，企业的核心地位越高，对拍卖价格有积极影响。这种影响会受到企业知名度和媒体报道基调的调节。我们使用了来自奢侈制表行业的独特数据集对模型进行了检验。

Managerial Summary
We demonstrate that a firm's performance is shaped not only by how prominently or positively it is featured in the media, but also by the relational context in which it is mentioned. Firms that are frequently mentioned alongside other key industry players are perceived to be the core of the industry, leading to higher auction prices for their products. The effect is strengthened when a firm enjoys frequent and positive media coverage. For managers, our findings underscore the importance of understanding how and why the media associates their brand with others, as this can enhance its value in secondary markets, and thus potentially boost value capture in primary markets. Our analysis explores the luxury watchmaking industry, a setting that is rarely studied.

管理总结
我们证明了一家企业的表现不仅取决于它在媒体上曝光的显著程度或正面程度，还取决于媒体提及它时所处的关联情境。那些经常与其他行业关键参与者一同被提及的企业，会被视为行业的核心，这会使其产品在拍卖中获得更高的价格。当一家企业得到频繁且正面的媒体报道时，这种影响会进一步增强。对于管理者而言，我们的研究结果强调了理解媒体如何以及为何将他们的品牌与其他品牌联系起来的重要性，因为这可以提升品牌在二级市场的价值，从而有可能在一级市场提升价值获取能力。我们的分析以奢侈制表行业为研究对象，这是一个很少被研究的领域。

### The role of military directors in holding the CEO accountable for poor firm performance​
​军人董事在追究CEO因公司业绩不佳而承担责任中的作用

Research Summary

Why do some boards of directors dismiss the CEO when a firm performs poorly, while others do not? We argue that military directors—outside directors with military backgrounds—on the board increase the likelihood of CEO dismissal under low-performance conditions. Military service instills a lifelong system of values and beliefs related to accountability—the obligation to accept responsibility for one's own actions and outcomes—which leads military directors to attribute low performance to the CEO and hold the CEO strictly accountable for such performance. This argument is supported by extensive quantitative data on CEO dismissal in publicly listed firms and qualitative data obtained from interviews with military directors who have served on boards of those firms.

研究总结

为什么有些公司董事会在公司业绩不佳时会解雇首席执行官（CEO），而另一些却不会呢？我们认为，董事会中的军人董事（具有军事背景的外部董事）会增加公司在业绩不佳情况下解雇 CEO 的可能性。军旅生涯会给人灌输一套与问责制相关的、伴随一生的价值观和信念体系，即对自己的行为和结果承担责任的义务，这使得军人董事将公司的低业绩归咎于 CEO，并要求 CEO 对这种业绩表现严格负责。关于上市公司 CEO 被解雇情况的大量定量数据，以及从对曾在这些公司董事会任职的军人董事的访谈中获得的定性数据，都支持了这一观点。

Managerial Summary

Military directors—outside directors with military backgrounds—frequently occupy seats on the boards of publicly listed firms in the United States. Military service instills an enduring system of values and beliefs rooted in accountability, which, we argue, makes military directors more inclined to attribute performance shortfalls to the CEO and advocate for more rigorous CEO accountability, resulting in CEO dismissal. Our argument is supported by quantitative data on CEO dismissals within publicly listed firms and qualitative data derived from interviews with military directors who have served on boards of those firms. Our findings underscore that principles ingrained via military service may influence corporate governance, particularly one of its core components: executive accountability.

管理总结

军人董事，即具有军事背景的外部董事，经常在美国上市公司的董事会中占据一席之地。我们认为，军旅生涯会灌输一套基于问责制的持久价值观和信念体系，这使得军人董事更倾向于将业绩不佳归咎于 CEO，并主张对 CEO 实行更严格的问责制，从而导致 CEO 被解雇。关于上市公司 CEO 被解雇情况的定量数据，以及从对曾在这些公司董事会任职的军人董事的访谈中获得的定性数据，都支持了我们的观点。我们的研究结果强调，通过军旅生涯所形成的根深蒂固的原则可能会影响公司治理，尤其是公司治理的核心要素之一：高管问责制。

### Corporate social responsibility in the age of activist directorships​
​激进主义董事时代的企业社会责任

Research Summary
We draw attention to a rapidly emerging phenomenon—the appointment of activist-nominated directors to boards—that could have consequences for stakeholders. Although appointing an activist director tends to improve firm value for shareholders, we uncover a hidden externality wherein it also yields increased reports of stakeholder harm. We introduce activist directors to the management literature and examine an array of considerations with a view toward launching a stream of literature that explores nuanced forms of activist directorships, intemporal trade-offs in their influence, and the breadth and depth of their behavioral consequences for firms.

研究总结

我们关注到一个迅速兴起的现象 —— 将维权股东提名的董事任命进入董事会，这可能会对利益相关者产生影响。尽管任命一名维权董事往往会提升公司对股东而言的价值，但我们发现了一个隐藏的外部性，即这也会导致利益相关者受到损害的报告增多。我们将维权董事的概念引入管理文献领域，并审视了一系列相关因素，旨在开启一系列研究文献，探索维权董事这种细微复杂的形式、其影响力在不同时间维度上的权衡，以及其对公司产生的行为后果的广度和深度。

Managerial Summary

Historically, activist shareholders have primarily tried to affect managerial decision-making from their vantage point as outsiders. Today, activist investors are going further by demanding their own seats at the boardroom table. We examine the consequences of these activist directorships, finding that they are associated with increased reports of stakeholder harm. Supplemental analyses show that, while activist directors bring immediate benefits to shareholders, they appear to impose a managerial myopia wherein executives become less inclined to make long-term investments. Moreover, the adverse effects on stakeholder harm are most profound when a director is a delegate, meaning they work directly for an activist investor, as opposed to a trustee, who is appointed by, but does not work for, an activist investor.

管理总结

从历史上看，维权股东主要是从外部人的角度试图影响管理层的决策。如今，维权投资者更进一步，要求在董事会中获得自己的席位。我们研究了这些维权董事任职所带来的后果，发现这与利益相关者受到损害的报告增多有关。补充分析表明，虽然维权董事能给股东带来直接利益，但他们似乎会导致管理层的短视行为，即高管们不太愿意进行长期投资。此外，当一名董事是代表（即他们直接为维权投资者工作）时，对利益相关者造成损害的负面影响最为严重，而受托人（由维权投资者任命，但不为其工作）的情况则相对不同。
